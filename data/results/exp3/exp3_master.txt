Correct Answers:
===============
The value of the repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of $80,000, or $120,000.
So the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The value of the repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
Therefore, the house is now worth 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value due to repairs was 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value was 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
So he made 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000
So the profit is $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repair costs increased the value of the house by 150%, so the final value of the house is 150% of the original value. 

First, calculate 150% of $80,000: $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

However, this final value includes the repair costs. To find the profit, we need to subtract the repair costs from the final value. 

Profit = Final Value - Repair Costs = $120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value can be found by multiplying the original value of the house ($80,000) by the percentage increase (150% or 1.5). Thus, the increase in value is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

To find the total value of the house after the increase, we add the original value and the increase in value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expense (original price + cost of repairs) from the total value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. 

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
Therefore, the new value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Since Josh spent 80,000 + 50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 in total.
His profit is 200,000 - 130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the final value of the house is 80000 + 120000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
The total cost of the house and repairs is 80000 + 50000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.
Therefore, the profit made is 200000 - 130000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.
Considering the initial cost of the repairs, the profit he made is 200,000 - 130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repair costs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the house is now worth 100% + 150% = 250% of its original value.
So the value of the repaired house is 80,000 * 2.5 = $<<80000*2.5=200000>>200,000.
Josh's total investment was 80,000 + 50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.
Therefore, he made a profit of 200,000 - 130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The value of the house increased by 80,000*1.5=$120,000.
So it was worth 80,000+120,000=$200,000.
Therefore, his profit was 200,000-(80,000+50,000)=$70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is 80,000 * 150% = $<<80000*150*.01=120000>>120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, the profit made by Josh is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
So the house is worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
That means Josh made a profit of $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in the value of the house was 150% of $80,000, which is $120,000. So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000. 
Since his total costs were $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs is 150% of the original cost, which is 150% * $80,000 = $<<150*.01*80000=120000>>120,000.
Therefore, the final value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Josh's profit is the final value of the house minus the total cost, which is $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the house is worth 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
That means he made a profit of 200,000-(80,000+50,000)=$<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house by the percentage increase: 80,000 * 150% = 120,000
The final value of the house is the sum of the original value and the increase in value: 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
To find the profit, subtract the sum of the purchase price and repair costs from the final value: 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in the value of the house is 150% of $80,000 which is 1.5 * $80,000 = $<<1.5*80000=120000>>120,000.
Therefore, the final value of the house is $120,000 + $80,000 = $<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000.
Since Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the purchase and repairs, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of $80,000, which is $120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Since Josh spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 for repairs, his total costs were $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
So, he made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: $\boxed{70000}$.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% so the house is worth 80,000 + (80,000 * 1.5) = $<<80000+(80000*1.5)=200000>>200,000.
So he made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Since his total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs is 80,000*150%=$<<80000*150*.01=120000>>120,000
So the house is now worth 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Therefore, his profit is 200,000-(80,000+50,000)=$<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in the value of the house was 150% of the original value, which is 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, his total costs were $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
Thus, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value was 80,000*1.5=$120,000
So the total value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$200,000
That means he made a profit of 200,000-(80,000+50,000)=$70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, the profit made by selling the house is 200,000 - 130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the house increased by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
His profit is the total value of the house after repairs minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value was 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the new value was 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000 * 1.50 = $<<80000*1.50=120000>>120,000.
So the new value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Since Josh spent a total of 80,000 + 50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on purchasing and repairing the house.
His profit is 200,000 - 130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value is 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000
So the house is now worth 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000
His profit is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the repairs was 80,000 * 150% = $<<80000*150*.01=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house after repairs was 120,000 + 80,000 = $<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
Since Josh bought the house for $80,000 and sold it for $200,000, his profit was 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the final value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, he made a profit of 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000)=$<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value from the repairs was $80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house ($80,000) by the percentage increase (150%), which is 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

The total value of the house after the repairs is the original value of the house plus the increase in value, which is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 

To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total cost of buying the house and making repairs from the total value of the house after repairs. 

The total cost of buying the house and making repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 

Therefore, the profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. 

Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.
Since Josh spent a total of 80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000, his profit is 200,000 - 130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
However, the total cost of buying the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 
Therefore, the profit made by Josh is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000.
Thus, the final value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000.
Josh's profit is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = 70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is 80,000 * 1.50 = $<<80000*1.50=120000>>120,000
So the house is now worth 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
His profit is the value of the house after repairs minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repair increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the house is worth 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
That means he had a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The 150% increase in value is equal to 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$200,000
His profit is the new value of the house minus the initial cost of the house and the cost of repairs, which is 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000.
Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

===============
The repairs increased the value of the house by $50,000 * 150% = $75,000.
So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
Therefore, his profit is $155,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
Therefore, the new value of the house is 80,000 + 50,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+50000+120000=250000>>250,000.
The profit made by Josh is 250,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $<<250000-(80000+50000)=120000>>120,000. Answer: \boxed{120,000}.

The increase in value of the house is 150% of the repair costs, which is 150/100 * $50,000 = $75,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
Since Josh spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 on repairs, his total costs were $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
His profit is then $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 50,000 * 150% = $75,000.
So the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
Therefore, his profit is $155,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is found by multiplying the repair cost by the percentage increase: $50,000 * 1.5 = $<<50000*1.5=75000>>75,000. 
The value of the house after repairs is the sum of the purchase price and the increase in value: $80,000 + $75,000 = $<<80000+75000=155000>>155,000. 
To find the profit, subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the value after repairs: $155,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $155,000 - $130,000 = $<<155000-130000=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total investment was 80,000+50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
Therefore, the profit he made is 120,000-130,000 = $<<120000-130000=-10000>>-10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10000}.

The value of the repairs increased the value of the house by 50,000*150%=$75,000
So the total value of the house is 80,000+75,000=$155,000
Therefore, he made a profit of 155,000-80,000-50,000=$<<155000-80000-50000=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The value of the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, so the increase in value is $50,000 * 1.5 = $75,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
Since Josh spent a total of $130,000 ($80,000 for the purchase and $50,000 for repairs), his profit is $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000. 
Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The value of the repairs increased the house value by 150% which is $50,000 * 1.5 = $75,000
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000
His total investment including the purchase price and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000
Therefore, his profit is $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 + $120,000 = $250,000.
Therefore, the profit he made is $250,000 - $80,000 = $170,000.
Answer: \boxed{170000}.

The repair costs increased the value of the house to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
So the value of the repairs increased the value by 130,000*150%=$<<130000*150*.01=195000>>195,000
That means the house was worth 130,000+195,000=$<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000
So he had a profit of 325,000-(80,000+50,000)=$<<325000-(80000+50000)=195000>>195,000. Answer: \boxed{195,000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs is $50,000*150%=$<<50000*150*.01=75000>>75,000
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000+$75,000=$<<80000+75000=155000>>155,000
Therefore, Josh's profit is $155,000-$80,000-$50,000=$<<155000-80000-50000=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The repair increased the value of the house by 150% or 1.5 times the original value. Therefore, the new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost of the house and repairs from the final value of the house: $120,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.

Since the result is negative, it means that Josh did not make a profit but actually incurred a loss of $10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10,000}.

To find the profit, we need to first calculate the final value of the house. The increase in value due to repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. Therefore, the final value of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 + $120,000 = $250,000. To find the profit, we need to subtract the initial cost of the house and the cost of repairs from the final value: $250,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $120,000. Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000. Answer: \boxed{120,000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is 80,000*.5=$<<80000*.5=40000>>40,000
So the house is worth 80,000+40,000=$<<80000+40000=120000>>120,000 after the repairs
That means he made a profit of 120,000-80,000-50,000=$<<120000-80000-50000=40000>>40,000. Answer: \boxed{40000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is 50,000*150%=$75,000
The final value of the house is 80,000+75,000=$155,000
Thus, Josh made a profit of 155,000-(80,000+50,000)=$25,000. Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The value of the repairs is 50,000.  The value of the repairs increased the value of the house by 150% so the value of the house increase is 50,000*1.5 = 75,000
Therefore, the total value increase is 50,000+75,000 = 125,000
The total value of the house after the repairs is 80,000+125,000 = 205,000
Josh sold the house for 205,000-80,000 = 125,000 profit. Answer: \boxed{125,000}.

The increase in value was 80,000*.15=$12,000
So the new value of the house was 80,000+12,000=$92,000
So he made a profit of 92,000-(80,000+50,000)=$-38,000. Answer: \boxed{-38,000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
The total cost of the house with repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.
Answer: \boxed{-$10,000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs is 50000*.15=$<<50000*.15=7500>>7500.
So the value of the house after repairs is 80000+7500=$<<80000+7500=87500>>87500.
Therefore, his profit is 87500-(80000+50000)=$<<87500-(80000+50000)=7500>>7500. Answer: \boxed{7500}.

The increase in value added to the house is 80000 * 1.5 = 120000. 
Therefore, the value of the house after the repairs is 80000 + 50000 + 120000 = 250000. 
Hence, Josh made a profit of 250000 - 80000 = 170000. Answer: 170000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 + $120,000 = $250,000.
That means the profit he made was $250,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $120,000. Answer: \boxed{120,000}.

The increase in value of the house was 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
Since Josh spent a total of 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house
His profit is 120,000-130,000=$<<120000-130000=-10000>>-10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10,000}.

The value of the house increased by 150%, which means it increased by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the final value of the house is 80,000+50,000+120,000=$<<80000+50000+120000=250000>>250,000.
Therefore, the profit made by Josh is 250,000-80,000=$<<250000-80000=170000>>170,000. Answer: \boxed{170000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs was 150% of $50,000, which is $75,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the total value.
The total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
Therefore, the profit is $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value of the house increased by 0.5*150000 = $75,000.
So the value of the house after the repairs is 80,000+75,000 = $155,000.
Josh spent a total of 80,000+50,000 = $130,000 on the house and repairs.
Therefore, his profit is 155,000-130,000 = $25,000. 
Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value, which is $80,000*1.5 = $120,000. 
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 + $120,000 = $250,000.
Therefore, the profit he made is $250,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $120,000. Answer: \boxed{120,000}.

The increase in value of the house is 150/100 * $50,000 = $75,000.
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
Since Josh invested a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000, his profit is $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The increase in value added 80,000*.15=$12,000 to its value
So the house is now worth 80,000+12,000=$92,000
His total costs were 80,000+50,000=$130,000
So he made a profit of 92,000-130,000=$-38,000. Answer: \boxed{-38000}.

The value of the repairs on the house is $80,000. Since the house's value increased by 150%, this means that the value after repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. Therefore, his profit is $120,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $40,000. Answer: \boxed{40,000}.

The value of the repairs is 50,000*1.5=$<<50000*1.5=75000>>75,000. 
So the total value of the house is 80,000+75,000=$<<80000+75000=155000>>155,000. 
Therefore, his profit is 155,000-80,000-50,000=$<<155000-80000-50000=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80000*.15=$<<80000*.15=12000>>12000
That means the value of the house after the repairs was 80000+12000=$<<80000+12000=92000>>92000
So he made a profit of 92000-80000-50000=$<<92000-80000-50000=62000>>62000. Answer: \boxed{62000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value. Since the original value of the house is $80,000, the increase in value is $80,000 * 150% = $120,000. 
So, the final value of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 (repairs) + $120,000 (increase in value) = $250,000.
Therefore, the profit he made is $250,000 - $80,000 = $170,000. Answer: \boxed{170000}.

The repair costs increased the value of the house to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130,000>>130,000
So the value of the repairs increased the value by 130,000*150%=$<<130000*150*.01=195,000>>195,000
That means the house was worth 130,000+195,000=$<<130000+195000=325,000>>325,000
He made a profit of 325,000-80,000-50,000=$<<325000-80000-50000=195,000>>195,000. Answer: \boxed{195,000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
The total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 + $120,000 = $250,000.
Therefore, the profit he made is $250,000 - $80,000 = $170,000. Answer: \boxed{170000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house to 80000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So his total investment is 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
That means his profit is 120,000-130,000=-$10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10,000}.

The value of the repairs is 80000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So he made a profit of 120,000-80,000-50,000=$<<120000-80000-50000=40000>>40,000. Answer: \boxed{40000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80000*.015=$<<80000*.015=1200>>1,200
So the house is worth 80000+1200=$<<80000+1200=81200>>81,200
So the total cost is 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
That means he had a 81200-130000=-<<81200-130000=-48800>>48,800 loss. Answer: \boxed{48800}.

The increase in value due to repairs is 150% of $50,000, which is 1.5 * $50,000 = $75,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
Josh's total cost for purchasing and repairing the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $155,000 - $130,000 = $<<155000-130000=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The increase in value was 80,000*.15=$<<80000*.15=12000>>12,000
So the total value of the house is 80,000+12,000=$<<80000+12000=92000>>92,000
His profit was the total value of the house minus the cost of the house and repairs: 92,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = <<92000-(80000+50000)=62000>>62,000. Answer: \boxed{62,000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is 50,000*150%=$75,000
So the total value of the house is now 80,000+75,000=$155,000
His initial investment was 80,000+50,000=$130,000
Therefore, his profit is 155,000-130,000=$<<155000-130000=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value, which is 150% * $80,000 = $120,000. 
The final value of the house is the sum of its original value, repair costs, and the increase in value, so it is $80,000 + $50,000 + $120,000 = $250,000. 
Josh made a profit of the final value minus the cost of buying the house and repairs, which is $250,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $170,000. 
Answer: \boxed{170,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 50,000*1.5=$<<50000*1.5=75000>>75,000
So the total value of the house after the repair is 80,000+75,000=$<<80000+75000=155000>>155,000
That means he made a profit of 155,000-(80,000+50,000)=$<<155000-(80000+50000)=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 120,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 120,000 - 130,000 = -10,000.
Since the answer cannot be negative, Josh did not make a profit and actually incurred a loss of $10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10,000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000
Therefore, the new value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
His profit is the new value of the house minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = 70,000. Answer: 70,000.

The repair increased the value of the house by 150/100*50000=$75,000. 
So the total value of the house was 80,000+75,000=$155,000. 
That means he made a profit of 155,000-130,000=$25,000. Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The increase in value is 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
His profit is the increase in value minus the initial cost, so 120,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<120000-80000-50000=40000>>40,000. Answer: \boxed{40,000}.

The increase in value was 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total cost was 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
Therefore, the profit made was 120,000-130,000=$<<120000-130000=-10000>>-10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10,000}.

The repair cost increased the value of the house by 150%, so it added 150/100 * $50,000 = $<<150/100*50000=75000>>75,000.
So the total value of the house is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.
The purchase price of the house was $80,000 and the repairs cost him $50,000 for a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.
If he sells the house for $155,000, then he made a profit of $155,000 - $130,000 = $<<155000-130000=25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value, which is 150% of $80,000. To find this amount, we can calculate 150% of $80,000:

80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000

So, the value of the house after repairs is $120,000. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the final value:

$120,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000

Since the result is negative, it means that Josh had a loss of $10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10,000}.

The increase in value is 150/100 * $50,000 = $75,000. 
So the new value of the house is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000. 
Therefore, his profit is $155,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

First, calculate the increase in value by multiplying the original value of the house by 150%: $80,000 * 150% = $120,000.

Next, subtract the cost of repairs from the increased value to find the value of the house after repairs: $120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.

Finally, subtract the sum of the original cost and the cost of repairs from the value of the house after repairs to find the profit: $70,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = -$60,000.

Since the result is negative, it means that Josh actually made a loss of $60,000 on the house. Answer: 60000.

The increase in value was 80,000*.15=$<<80000*.15=12000>>12000
That means the final value of the house was 80,000+12,000=$<<80000+12000=92000>>92,000
So the profit was 92,000-50,000-80,000=$<<92000-50000-80000=62000>>62,000. Answer: \boxed{62000}.

To find the profit, we need to determine the final value of the house and subtract the total cost. The increase in value is 150% of the initial value, which is $80,000. So, the increase in value is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
The final value of the house is the sum of the initial value, cost of repairs, and the increase in value, which is $80,000 + $50,000 + $120,000 = $250,000. 
To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the final value: $250,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $120,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000. Answer: \boxed{120000}.

The repair costs increased the value of the house by 150%, so the value of the house after repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
Since Josh spent $80,000 on buying the house and $50,000 on repairs, his total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000 - $130,000 = $<<120000-130000=-10000>>-10,000. Answer: \boxed{-10000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is 80,000*.015=$<<80000*.015=1200>>1,200
So the total value of the house is 80,000+1,200=$<<80000+1200=81200>>81,200
That means his profit is 81,200-80,000-50,000=$<<81200-80000-50000=12800>>12,800. Answer: \boxed{12,800}.

The increase in value due to repairs was 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the final value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $70,000. Answer: 70,000.

The increase in value was 80,000*.15=$<<80000*.15=12000>>12,000
So the new value of the house is 80,000+12,000=$<<80000+12000=92000>>92,000
His total investment was 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
Therefore, his profit is 92,000-130,000=-$<<92000-130000=-38000>>38,000. Answer: \boxed{38,000}.

The increase in value of the house was 150% of $50,000, which is $50,000 * 1.5 = $75,000. 
Therefore, the new value of the house is the sum of the original value ($80,000) and the increase in value ($75,000), which is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000. 
To find the profit, we deduct the total cost of buying the house and repairs from the new value of the house. 
The total cost is the sum of the purchase price ($80,000) and the cost of repairs ($50,000), which is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 
The profit is the new value of the house ($155,000) minus the total cost ($130,000), which is $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.

The increase in value due to repairs was 150/100*50000=$75,000
So the final value of the house is 80,000+75,000=$155,000
Therefore, his profit is 155,000-80,000-50,000=$25,000. Answer: \boxed{25,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 50,000*150%=$<<50000*150*.01=75000>>75,000
So the total value of the house after the repair is 80,000+75,000=$<<80000+75000=155000>>155,000
That means he profited 155,000-(80,000+50,000)=$<<155000-(80000+50000)=+25000>>25,000. Answer: \boxed{25000}.
