Question: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?

Correct Answers:
===============
The value of the house increased by 80,000*1.5=$120,000
So the final value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$200,000
Since he spent 80,000+50,000=$130,000 to buy and repair the house,
His profit is 200,000-130,000=$70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repair increased the value of the house by 80000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000. 
Therefore, the value of the house is 80000+120000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000. 
Since Josh spent a total of 80000+50000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house, his profit is 200000-130000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. 
Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total value of the house is 120,000 + 80,000 = $<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
He bought the house for 80,000 + 50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
Therefore, he made a profit of 200,000 - 130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Josh made a profit of $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total value of the house is $80,000+$120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
His profit is the total value of the house minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is $200,000-$80,000-$50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Josh's profit is calculated as the total value of the house minus the initial cost and the cost of repairs: $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So, the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. 
Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total value of the house is now 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Thus, Josh's profit is 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the total value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of $80,000, which is $80,000*1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of its original value, which is 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.
So the final value of the house is $120,000 + $80,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repair costs increased the house price by 150/100=1.5
So the value of the house went up by 80,000*1.5=$120,000
So the total value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$200,000
That means he made a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value is 150/100 * 80,000 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh's profit is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000

Therefore, he made a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Josh's profit is equal to the total value of the house minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Therefore, he made a profit of 200,000 - (80,000+50,000) = $<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value due to the repairs was 150/100*80000=$<<150/100*80000=120000>>120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is 80000+120000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
This means Josh made a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repair increased the value of the house by 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the house increased by 150% of $80,000, which is $120,000. So the house is now worth $120,000 + $80,000 = $200,000. 
Since he bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs, his total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 
Therefore, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The value of the house increased by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
That means he made a profit of 200,000-(80,000+50,000)=$<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value was $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
That means his profit was $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.

The value of the repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
So, the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
Therefore, his profit is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 
Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is calculated as 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
So, the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value from the repairs was $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000
So the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The value of the house increased by 150%, which is the same as multiplying the original value by 1.5. Therefore, the increased value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

To find the total value of the house after repairs, we add the increased value to the original value: $120,000 + $80,000 = $200,000. 

To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost of buying the house and making repairs from the total value of the house after repairs: $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000
Therefore, the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000
Since Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs, his total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000
Therefore, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. 
Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house ($80,000) by the percentage increase (150%) which is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

So, the new value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 

To calculate the profit, we subtract the cost of repairs ($50,000) and the original price ($80,000) from the new value of the house: $200,000 - $50,000 - $80,000 = $70,000. 

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 150% = $120,000.
So the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value was 80,000*1.5=$120,000
So the total value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$200,000
That means he made a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the house increased by 80,000*1.5=$120,000
So the value of the house after repairs is 80,000+120,000=$200,000
His profit is the final value of the house minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is 200,000-80,000-50,000=$70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The value of the house increased by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
Therefore, the total value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Hence, Josh made a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value is 80,000 * 1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Therefore, his profit is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the repairs is 150/100*80000=$<<150/100*80000=120000>>120,000
So the total price of the house after repairs is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
So Josh made a profit of 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The value of the house increased by 150% of $80,000, which is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
To find the profit, we subtract the purchase price and repair cost from the total value of the house: 
$200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the repairs is 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the house is now worth 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
That means his profit is 200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house is given by 150% of $80,000, which is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.
So, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The value of the repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of $80,000, which is $120,000. Therefore, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. Josh's profit is the total value of the house after repairs minus the cost of the house and the cost of repairs, which is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The value of the house increased by 150% of $80,000, which is equal to 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.
Therefore, the final value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Since Josh spent $80,000 on purchasing the house and $50,000 on repairs, his total expenses are $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
His profit is therefore $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the total value of the house is now $80,000+$120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
That means he made a profit of $200,000-$80,000-$50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The amount of increase in value is 80,000 * (150/100) = $<<80000*(150/100)=120000>>120,000. 
So the total value of the house after repairs is 120,000 + 80,000 = $<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the total value of the house was 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Since Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs, his total cost was 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.
Therefore, his profit is the total value of the house minus his total cost, which is 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
Josh's profit will be the total value of the house after repairs minus the cost of the house and the cost of repairs, which is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to the repairs is $80,000 * 150% = $120,000. Therefore, the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. Since Josh spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 for repairs, his total cost is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Therefore, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000.
The profit made by Josh is the total value of the house after repairs minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
The total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

Therefore, Josh's profit is 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $70,000.
Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value is 80,000 * 150/100 = $<<80000*150/100=120000>>120,000
So the total value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Therefore, his profit is 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value due to repairs is $80,000 * 150% = $120,000.
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

To calculate the profit, we need to find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value increased by 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

So, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 

To calculate the profit, we subtract the sum of the purchase price and repair costs from the total value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. 

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70000}.

The increase in value was 80,000*1.5=$120,000.
So the total value of the house was 80,000+120,000=$200,000.
His profit was 200,000-(80,000+50,000)=$70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
Therefore, the value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000
Since Josh spent 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house,
his profit is 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house is 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000. 
The total value of the house is now 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = 70,000. 
Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is calculated as 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000. 
The total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = 70,000. 
Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000.
So the total value of the house is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000.
Therefore, the profit Josh made is 200,000-(80,000+50,000)=$<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house by the percentage increase in value, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000. 
So the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost of purchasing the house and the cost of repairs from the final value of the house, which is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value is given by 80,000*1.5 = $<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000

So the new value of the house is 80,000 + 120,000 = $<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000

His profit is the new value of the house minus the cost of the house and repairs, which is 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $<<200000-(80000+50000)=70000>>70,000.

Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value of the house due to repairs is 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000. Therefore, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. Hence, his profit is $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. Answer: \boxed{70,000}.

The increase in value is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.

Incorrect Answers:
===============
The increase in the value of the house due to the repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
Josh's profit is the total value of the house minus the initial cost and repair costs, which is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 
Answer: $70,000.

The increase in value is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house ($80,000) by the percentage increase (150%). This gives an increase of $120,000. 

To find the total value of the house after repairs, we add the repair cost ($50,000) to the increased value ($120,000). This gives a total value of $170,000.

Finally, to calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost of purchasing the house and making repairs ($80,000 + $50,000) from the total value of the house after repairs ($170,000). This gives a profit of $40,000.

Answer: \boxed{40,000}.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000*1.5=$120,000
So the total value of the house is now $80,000+$120,000=$200,000
That means he made a profit of $200,000-$80,000-$50,000=$70,000. 

Answer: $70,000

The increase in value is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house by the percentage increase. In this case, 80,000 * 150% = $120,000. 
So, the total value of the house after the repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000. 
To calculate the profit, we subtract the cost of repairs from the total value of the house: 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = $70,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The increase in value of the house can be calculated by multiplying the original value of the house by the percentage increase: 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000. 

Adding the increase in value to the original value gives us the total value of the house: 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000. 

To find the profit, we subtract the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost from the total value: 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 70,000.

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000 from flipping the house.

The increase in value due to repairs is 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = 70,000. Answer: 70,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.
So the final value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 
Answer: $70,000.

The increase in value is found by multiplying the original value of the house ($80,000) by the percentage increase (150%) in decimal form (1.5). So the increase in value is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

To find the total value of the house after repairs, we add the increase in value to the original value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 

Finally, to determine the profit, we subtract the total value of the house after repairs from the sum of the original purchase price and the cost of repairs: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000.

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

To find the profit, we need to calculate the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

So the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 

Therefore, the profit Josh made is $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. 

Answer: $70,000

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000. 
So the total value of the house is $80,000+$120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000. 
To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of buying the house and the cost of repairs from the total value of the house. 
So his profit was $200,000-$80,000-$50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. 
Thus, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The increase in value was calculated by multiplying the original value of the house, $80,000, by the percentage increase, 150%. Therefore, the increase in value is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 

To determine the new value of the house after the repairs, we add the increase in value to the original value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 

Finally, to calculate the profit, we subtract the cost of repairs, $50,000, and the original cost of the house, $80,000, from the new value of the house: $200,000 - $50,000 - $80,000 = $70,000. 

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The repair work increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=$<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000. 
So the value of the house after the repairs is 80,000+120,000=$<<80000+120000=200000>>200,000. 
To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the house and repairs from the current value of the house: 
200,000-80,000-50,000=$<<200000-80000-50000=70000>>70,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The increase in value of the house due to the repairs is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
Therefore, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
Since Josh spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 on repairs, his total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 
To find his profit, we subtract his total investment from the total value of the house: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000. Answer: $70,000.

The increase in value of the house is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house by the percentage increase, which is 80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
By adding this increase to the original purchase price, the total value of the house becomes 120,000 + 80,000 = $200,000. 
To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses (original purchase price + cost of repairs) from the total value of the house: 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $70,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of $80,000, which is $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
So the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
His profit is the total value of the house minus the cost of buying the house and the cost of repairs, which is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 
Answer: The profit he made is $70,000.

The increase in value is calculated by multiplying the original value of the house ($80,000) by the percentage increase (150%). This gives us $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
Adding this increase in value to the original value of the house gives us the new total value of the house: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
To calculate the profit, we subtract the cost of the house ($80,000) and the cost of repairs ($50,000) from the total value of the house. This gives us $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. 
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000*1.5=$120,000. So the total value of the house is now $80,000+$120,000=$200,000. 

Josh's total expenses were the cost of buying the house, $80,000, plus the cost of repairs, $50,000, which equals $130,000. 

Therefore, his profit is the total value of the house, $200,000, minus his expenses, $130,000, which equals $70,000. 

Answer: $70,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
So the total value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000. Answer: $70,000.

The repairs increased the value of the house by 80,000 * 150% = 120,000.
So the total value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000.
Therefore, Josh made a profit of 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 70,000. Answer: 70,000.

The increase in value of the house is 150% of $80,000, which is (150/100) * $80,000 = $120,000. Therefore, the value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. 
Since Josh spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 on repairs, his total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 
Therefore, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. Answer: $70,000.
