{"id": "exp2_68", "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?", "text": "To calculate the profit, we need to find the total value of the house after the repairs. \n\nThe repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value increased by 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000. \n\nSo, the total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. \n\nTo calculate the profit, we subtract the sum of the purchase price and repair costs from the total value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000. \n\nTherefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.
