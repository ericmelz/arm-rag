How many vibrations does he experience?\n\nAt the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster than the lowest setting, or 1600*.6= <<1600*.6=960>>960 more vibrations per second.\nSo at the highest setting, it vibrates at 1600+960=<<1600+960=2560>>2560 vibrations per second.\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, and he uses it for 5 minutes, then at the highest setting, he experiences 2560*60*5=<<2560*60*5=768000>>768,000 vibrations. Answer: \\boxed{768000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Pulsar, the shuffle-dancing bear, Polly, the pink prancing poodle, and Petra, the proud portly pachyderm, are entertainers at the Big Top Circus.  In one show, Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes.  Then, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.  And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nPolly stands on her back legs for 3 times as long as Pulsar's 10 minutes, for a total of 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nPetra stands on his back legs for 1/6 the time that Polly does, for a total of 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 minutes.\nAll together, the three entertainers stand on their back legs for 10+30+5=<<10+30+5=45>>45 minutes.

If it takes Lexie 20 minutes to run a mile, how long, in minutes, will it take Celia to 30 miles?\n", "text": "Celia runs twice as fast as Lexie, so she runs a mile in 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take Celia 10*30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes to run 30 miles. Answer: \\boxed{300}."}

He sells left-handed mice.  They cost 30% more than normal mice.  He sells 25 a day and his store is open every day except Sunday, Thursday, and Friday.  If normal mice cost $120 how much money does he make a week?\n\nThe left-handed mice cost $120 * 1.3 = $<<120*1.3=156>>156.\nHe sells mice 7 - 3 = <<7-3=4>>4 days a week.\nSo he sells 25 * 4 = <<25*4=100>>100 a week.\nThis means he makes 100 * $156 = $<<100*156=15600>>15,600.

He sells 25 a day and his store is open every day except Sunday, Thursday, and Friday.  If normal mice cost $120 how much money does he make a week?\n\nHe sells them for $120*.3=$<<120*.3=36>>36 more than regular mice\nSo he sells them for 120+36=$<<120+36=156>>156\nSo he makes 156*25=$<<156*25=3900>>3900 a day\nHe is open 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 days a week\nSo he makes 3900*4=$<<3900*4=15600>>15,600 a week.
