Answer: \\boxed{44}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom was putting hardwood flooring into his living room that measured 16' long and 20' wide.  The flooring comes 10 sq ft per box and he has already put down 250 sq ft of flooring.  How many more boxes does Tom need to complete the job?\n", "text": "The living room has an area of 16 * 20 = <<16*20=320>>320 square feet.\nTom has already put down 250 square feet of flooring, so he needs to cover an additional 320 - 250 = <<320-250=70>>70 square feet.\nEach box covers 10 square feet, so Tom needs 70 / 10 = <<70/10=7>>7 more boxes. Answer: \\boxed{7}."}
