How old is Heracles now?\n", "text": "Let's assume that Heracles is currently $x$ years old. According to the information given, Audrey is 7 years older than Heracles, so her age can be represented as $x+7$ years. \n\nIn 3 years, Audrey's age will be $x+7+3 = x+10$ years. We also know that in 3 years, Audrey will be twice as old as Heracles is now.
