His monthly bills include $1250 for rent, $150 on utilities, $400 into retirement & savings accounts, $300.00 on groceries/eating out, $200 for insurance and $200 for miscellaneous expenses.  If he\u2019s looking at buying a car with a monthly car payment of $350 how much does that leave for gas and maintenance?\n\nThe total of all the bills Kyle pays every month is $1250+$150+$400+$300+$200+$200 = $<<1250+150+400+300+200+200=2500>>2500.00\nWhen you subtract that number from his monthly salary his monthly budget is 3200-2500 = $<<3200-2500=700>>700.\nSince he will spend 350.00 a month on a car payment that leaves him with 700-350 = $<<700-350=350>>350 for gas and maintenance. Answer: \\boxed{350}.\n\n\nQuestion: Arnold owns three cars. The first car averages 50 miles per gallon of gas. The second car averages 10 miles per gallon of gas.

To make the breadcrumbs Melanie is going to tear 2 slices of bread into smaller pieces and then add them to a blender to grind them into fine crumbs. First she tears the bread slices each in half, then tears those halves in half. How many bread pieces is Melanie going to put into the blender?\n\nTo calculate the number of bread pieces, we need to determine how many times Melanie tears the bread slices.\n\nEach bread slice is torn in half, so 2 slices x 2 halves per slice = <<2*2=4>>4 halves of bread.\n\nThen, each half is torn in half again, resulting in 4 halves x 2 halves per half = <<4*2=8>>8 quarter-size pieces of bread.\n\nTherefore, Melanie is going to put 8 pieces of bread into the blender.

If she mixes the spinach with 6 ounces of cream cheese and 4 ounces of eggs, what is the total volume of the quiche?\n", "text": "First, we need to determine the cooked volume of the spinach. Since the spinach is cooked until it is 20% of its initial volume, we multiply the initial volume by 0.2:\n\n40 ounces x 0.2 = 8 ounces\n\nSo, the cooked spinach has a volume of 8 ounces.\n\nTo determine the total volume of the quiche, we add the volumes of the cooked spinach, cream cheese, and eggs:\n\n8 ounces (cooked spinach) + 6 ounces (cream cheese) + 4 ounces (eggs) = 18 ounces\n\nTherefore, the total volume of the quiche is 18 ounces.
