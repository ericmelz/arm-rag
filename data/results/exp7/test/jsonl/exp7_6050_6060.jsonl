Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby makes 400 rotations because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend does 404 rotations because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nThe winner made 404 rotations because 404 > 400\nThe winner made 404 rotations because 404 > 400. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Toby is in a juggling contest with a friend. The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes.

He again went up 7 floors and found that he is 9 floors away from the top of the building. How many floors does the building have?\n\nAfter going up 5 floors, Earl is now on the 1 + 5 = <<1+5=6>>6th floor.\nAfter going down 2 floors, Earl is now on the 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4th floor.\nAfter going up 7 floors, Earl is now on the 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11th floor.\nSince Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building, then the building has a total of 11 + 9 = <<11+9=20>>20 floors. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Kyle has a newspaper-delivery route. Every Monday through Saturday, he delivers the daily paper for the 100 houses on his route. On Sunday, 10 of his customers do not get the Sunday paper, but he delivers 30 papers to other houses that get the newspaper only on Sunday. How many papers does Kyle deliver each week?\n", "text": "Kyle delivers the daily paper to 100 houses from Monday to Saturday, which is a total of 100 x 6 = <<100*6=600>>600 papers.\nOn Sunday, he delivers the daily paper to the remaining 90 houses (100 - 10) and an additional 30 papers for houses that only get the newspaper on Sunday, which is a total of 90 + 30 = <<90+30=120>>120 papers.\nTherefore, Kyle delivers a total of 600 + 120 = <<600+120=720>>720 papers each week. Answer: \\boxed{720}."}
