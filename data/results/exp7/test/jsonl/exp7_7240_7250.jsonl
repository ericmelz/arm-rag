In the afternoon, she was able to sell 50 apples and 40 oranges. How much are her total sales for the day?\n\nWendy sold 40 + 50 = <<40+50=90>>90 apples for the whole day.\nSo, her total sales for apples is $1.50 x 90 = $<<1.5*90=135>>135.\nShe sold 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 oranges for the whole day.\nSo, her total sales for oranges is $1 x 70 = $<<1*70=70>>70.\nTherefore, the total sales of Wendy for the day is $135 + $70 = $<<135+70=205>>205.
