If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nLet's start by finding out how many women are at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 guests is (40/100)*200 = <<(40/100)*200=80>>80 women.\nOut of the 80 women, 80% are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 women is (80/100)*80 = <<(80/100)*80=64>>64 women.\nNow let's find out how many men are at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200 and that 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 men.\nOut of the 120 men, 60% are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 men is (60/100)*120 = <<(60/100)*120=72>>72 men.\nThe total number of people wearing rabbit ears is 64 women + 72 men = <<64+72=136>>136 people.

How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nEach tripodasaurus has one head and three legs, so in total, there are 1*x = x heads.\nAdditionally, each tripodasaurus has three legs, so the total number of legs is 3*x = 3x.\nThe problem states that the total number of heads and legs is 20, therefore we have the equation x + 3x = 20.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find x = 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nThere are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: 4/5 of the Easter eggs are blue and 1/5 are purple. Half the purple eggs have five pieces of candy each, and 1/4 of the blue eggs do. The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?\n\nFirst find what percentage of the Easter eggs are blue: 4/5 * 100% = 80%\nThen find what percentage of the Easter eggs are purple: 1/5 * 100% = 20%\nThen multiply the percentage of purple eggs by the percentage of purple eggs that have 5 pieces of candy to find the percentage chance of getting a 5-candy egg: 20% * 1/2 = 10%\nThen multiply the percentage of blue eggs by the percentage of blue eggs that have 5 pieces of candy to find the percentage chance of getting a 5-candy egg: 80% * 1/4 = 20%\nThen add those two probabilities to find the total probability of getting a 5-candy egg: 20% + 10% = 30%. Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: The tripodasaurus has three legs. In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume that there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nSince each tripodasaurus has 3 legs, the number of legs in the flock would be 3 * x = 3x.\nSince each tripodasaurus also has 1 head, the number of heads in the flock would be x.\nThe total number of heads and legs in the flock is 20 heads and legs, so x + 3x = 20.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nTherefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: The sum of the three numbers is 500. If the first number is 200, and the value of the second number is twice the value of the third number, find the value of the third number.\n", "text": "Let's assume that the second number is y and the third number is x.\nThe first number is given as 200.\nWe know that the sum of the three numbers is 500, so we can write the equation as 200 + y + x = 500.\nWe are also given that the second number is twice the value of the third number, so we can write the equation as y = 2x.\nSubstituting y = 2x into the first equation, we get 200 + 2x + x = 500.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x + 200 = 500.\nSubtracting 200 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 300.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 100.\nTherefore, the value of the third number is 100. Answer: \\boxed{100}."}
