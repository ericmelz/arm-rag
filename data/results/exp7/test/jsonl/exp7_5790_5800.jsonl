How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?\n", "text": "The area of the entire garden is 220 feet * 120 feet = 26400 square feet.\nHalf of the garden is tilled land, so the tilled land section is 26400 square feet / 2 = 13200 square feet.\nThe remaining area is 26400 square feet - 13200 square feet = 13200 square feet.\nA third of this area will have trellises, so the trellis section will be 13200 square feet / 3 = 4400 square feet.\nThe raised bed section is the remaining area, 13200 square feet - 4400 square feet = 8800 square feet. Answer: \\boxed{8800}."}
