The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\n\nThere are 25 men total and he needs 1/2 a gallon of water per man per day so he needs 25/2 = <<25/2=12.5>>12.5 gallons of water per day\nHe needs 12.5 gallons of water per day and the trip is 4,000 miles and he will travel 200 miles per day so he needs enough water for 4000/200 = <<4000/200=20>>20 days\nHe needs 12.5 gallons of water per day and he will need enough for 20 days so he will need 12.5*20 = <<12.5*20=250>>250 gallons of water. Answer: \\boxed{250}.\n\n\nQuestion: A tank contains 6000 liters of water, 2000 liters evaporated, and then 3500 liters were drained by Bob. How many liters are in the tank if it now rains for 30 minutes and every 10 minutes 350 liters of rain are added to the tank?\n\nAfter evaporation, there were 6000 liters - 2000 liters = <<6000-2000=4000>>4000 liters in the tank.\nAfter Bob drained the water, there were 4000 liters - 3500 liters = <<4000-3500=500>>500 liters in the tank.\nFor every 10 minutes of rain, 350 liters were added, so in 30 minutes 350 liters/10 minutes * 3 = <<350/10*3=1050>>1050 liters were added.\nAfter rain, there are 500 liters + 1050 liters = <<500+1050=1550>>1550 liters in the tank. Answer: \\boxed{1550}.\n\n\nQuestion: James has barrels that he uses to store water.  They store 3 gallons more than twice as much as a large cask.  If he has 4 barrels and a cask stores 20 gallons, how much water can he store?\n", "text": "Each barrel stores 3 + 2(20) = 43 gallons of water.\nJames has 4 barrels, so he can store 4(43) = 172 gallons of water. Answer: \\boxed{172}."}

On flat sand, it can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour.  When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand.  And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand.  If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?\n\nOn flat sand, Conner rides at a speed of 60 miles per hour.\nOn downhill slopes, he rides at a speed of 60 + 12 = <<60+12=72>>72 miles per hour.\nOn uphill inclined slopes, he rides at a speed of 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 miles per hour.\nConner spends 1/3 of his time on flat sand, and 1/3 of his time on uphill inclined slopes, so far he travels at a speed of (60 + 42) / 2 = <<(60+42)/2=51>>51 miles per hour.\nSince he spends 1/3 of his time on each type of terrain, the proportion of each type is 1/3.\nHis average speed is (60 + 72 + 42) / 3 = <<(60+72+42)/3=58>>58 miles per hour. Answer: \\boxed{58}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom decides to start running 5 days a week to lose weight.  He runs 1.5 hours each day.  He runs at a speed of 8 mph.  How many miles does he run a week?\n\nHe runs 5*1.5=<<5*1.5=7.5>>7.5 hours a week\nHe runs at a speed of 8 mph so he runs 7.5*8=<<7.5*8=60>>60 miles a week. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom decides to start running 5 days a week to lose weight.  He runs 1.5 hours each day.  He runs at a speed of 8 mph.

When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand.

If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?\n\nWhen riding on flat sand, the dune buggy takes 60 miles per hour (mph) to make a trip.\nWhen riding on downhill slopes, the dune buggy can travel at 60 + 12 = <<60+12=72>>72 mph.\nThis is 72 - 60 = <<72-60=12>>12 mph faster than on flat sand.\nAnd when riding on uphill inclined slopes, the dune buggy takes 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 mph.\nWhich is 18 mph slower than he goes on flat sand.\nSince he spends one-third of his time at each location, his average speed is (60 + 72 + 42)/3 = <<(60+72+42)/3=58>>58 mph.

From Monday to Wednesday he drove at an average speed of 12 kilometers per hour, and from Thursday to Friday at an average speed of 9 kilometers per hour. How many kilometers did the driver travel during these 5 days?\n", "text": "The bus driver drives for a total of 2 hours * 5 days = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.\nFrom Monday to Wednesday, he drives for 3 days * 2 hours = <<3*2=6>>6 hours at a speed of 12 kilometers per hour.\nThis means he travels 6 hours * 12 kilometers per hour = 72 kilometers.\nFrom Thursday to Friday, he drives for 2 days * 2 hours = <<2*2=4>>4 hours at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour.\nThis means he travels 4 hours * 9 kilometers per hour = 36 kilometers.\nSo in total, the bus driver travels 72 kilometers + 36 kilometers = <<72+36=108>>108 kilometers. Answer: \\boxed{108}."}
