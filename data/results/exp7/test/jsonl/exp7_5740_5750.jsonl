How much did the museum tickets cost in all?\n", "text": "The cost of student tickets is 12 x $1 = $<<12*1=12>>12.\nThe cost of adult tickets is 4 x $3 = $<<4*3=12>>12.\nTherefore, the museum tickets cost $12 + $12 = $<<12+12=24>>24 in all. Answer: \\boxed{24}."}

He takes a whole, uncut pepperoni pizza and cuts it in half.  He then cuts these halves in half and gives one of the slices to Jelly.  Assuming the pizza started with 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni, how many slices of it are on the slice Lard gives Jelly if 1 of them falls off the slice when Lard picks it up?\n\nFirst, we cut the pizza in half, so there are 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 slices on each half of the pizza.\nNext, we cut one of the halves in half, so there are now 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 slices on each quarter of the pizza.\nLard gives Jelly one of these slices, but 1 of them falls off, so there are 10-1=<<10-1=9>>9 slices of pepperoni on the slice Lard gives to Jelly. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lard decides to share a pizza with his friend Jelly.  He takes a whole, uncut pepperoni pizza and cuts it in half.  He then cuts these halves in half and gives one of the slices to Jelly.  Assuming the pizza started with 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni, how many slices of it are on the slice Lard gives Jelly if 1 of them falls off the slice when Lard picks it up?\n\nLard starts with a whole pizza and cuts it in half, so he has 1/2 * 40 = <<1/2*40=20>>20 slices of pepperoni on his slice\nThis slice is then cut in half again, so Lard gives Jelly 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 slices of pepperoni\nOne of these slices then falls off, so there are 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 slices of pepperoni left on the slice Lard gives to Jelly. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: A small pizza can gives 4 slices, and a large pizza gives 8 slices.  George purchased 3 small and 2 large pizzas.  George would like to eat 3 pieces.  His friend Bob would like to eat one more piece than George.  Susie will eat half as many as Bob.  Bill, Fred and Mark would each like 3 pieces.  How many slices of pizza will be left over?\n\nThree small pizzas give 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 slices.\nTwo large pizzas give 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 slices.\nGeorge wants to eat 3, Bob would like to eat 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 pieces.\nSusie would like to eat 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 pieces.\nBill, Fred and Mark each want to eat 3 pieces for a total of 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 pieces.\nThe small pizzas give 12 slices, the large pizza gives 16 slices, George wants 3, Bob wants 4, Susie wants 2 and the other three want 9 so there are 12+16-3-4-2-9=<<12+16-3-4-2-9=10>>10 slices left. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Matthew, Patrick and Alvin are eating dinner together. Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick eats. Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats. If Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, how many did Matthew eat?\n\nPatrick eats 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 egg rolls.\nMatthew eats 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 egg rolls. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lard decides to share a pizza with his friend Jelly.  He takes a whole, uncut pepperoni pizza and cuts it in half.  He then cuts these halves in half and gives one of the slices to Jelly.  Assuming the pizza started with 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni, how many slices of it are on the slice Lard gives Jelly if 1 of them falls off the slice when Lard picks it up?\n\nIf a pepperoni falls off of Lard's slice when he picks it up, there are originally 40-1=<<40-1=39>>39 slices of pepperoni on Lard's slice of pizza.\nSplitting the pizza into halves, there are 39/2=<<39/2=19.5>>19.5 slices of pepperoni on half of the pizza.\nSplitting this half into halves again, there are 19.5/2=<<19.5/2=9.75>>9.75 slices of pepperoni on Lard's slice of pizza. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Twelve coworkers go out for lunch together and order three pizzas. Each pizza is cut into eight slices. If each person gets the same number of slices, how many slices will each person get?\n", "text": "There are a total of 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 slices of pizza.\nIf each person gets the same number of slices, then each person will get 24 / 12 = <<24/12=2>>2 slices. Answer: \\boxed{2}."}
