If Reese is 60 inches tall, what is the average height for the three of them?\n\nIf Reese is 60 inches tall, and Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, Daisy's height is 60+8 = <<60+8=68>>68 inches.\nParker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, meaning he is 68-4 = <<68-4=64>>64 inches tall.\nThe total height for the three is 64+68+60 = <<64+68+60=192>>192 inches.\nThe average height for the three is 192/3 = <<192/3=64>>64 inches. Answer: \\boxed{64}.\n\n\nQuestion: Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese. If Reese is 60 inches tall, what is the average height for the three of them?\n\nDaisy is 60 + 8 = <<60+8=68>>68 inches tall.\nAnd since Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, then Parker is 68 - 4 = <<68-4=64>>64 inches tall.\nThus, the total height for the three of them is 68 + 64 + 60 = <<68+64+60=192>>192 inches.\nThus, the average height for the three of them is 192/3 = <<192/3=64>>64 inches.

He has 10 times as many pennies as quarters. How many nickels does he have?\n", "text": "Tommy has 4 quarters, and since he has 10 times as many pennies as quarters, he has 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 pennies.\nTommy also has 10 more dimes than pennies, so he has 40 + 10 = <<40+10=50>>50 dimes.\nSince he has twice as many nickels as dimes, Tommy has 50 * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 nickels.\nTherefore, Tommy has 100 nickels.
