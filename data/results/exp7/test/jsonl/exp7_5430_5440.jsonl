If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?\n\nWithout the triple word score bonus, the word was worth 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\nSince before the triple word score the first and third letters were worth one point apiece, they each account for a total of 1+1=<<1+1=2>>2 points.\nThus, the middle letter was valued at 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 points.

If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\n", "text": "Let the length of one side of the square be x. The perimeter of the square is equal to 4 times the length of one side, so the perimeter is 4x. Since the area of the circle is equal to the perimeter of the square, we have the equation 100 = 4x. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, giving us x = 100/4 = 25. Therefore, the length of one side of the square is 25 units. Answer: \\boxed{25}."}

On Wednesday he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies. How many cookies did he have at the end of the three days?\n\nOn Tuesday Zach baked 32 cookies / 2 = <<32/2=16>>16 cookies.\nOn Wednesday Zach baked 16 cookies * 3 = <<16*3=48>>48 cookies.\nAfter his brother ate, he was left with 48 cookies - 4 cookies = <<48-4=44>>44 cookies.\nIn total Zach had 32 cookies + 16 cookies + 44 cookies = <<32+16+44=92>>92 cookies after the three days.
