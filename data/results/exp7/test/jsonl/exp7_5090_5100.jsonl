On two days he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day and half the maximum time for the next two days. How many hours did William ride his horse during those 6 days?\n\nWilliam used the maximum riding time twice, so 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 hours.\nOn two days he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day, so in total 2 * 1.5 = <<2*1.5=3>>3 hours.\nHalf time of the maximum riding time is 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 hours.\nSo he rode his horse for 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours.\nSo William rode his horse in total for 12 + 3 + 6 = <<12+3+6=21>>21 hours in those 6 days.

When Maurice went to visit Matt for two weeks, he rode another 8 times. Each time, Matt went with him. Meanwhile, besides the times that Matt accompanied Maurice, he rode an additional 16 times. If the total number of times Matt rode during that two weeks is three times the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit, how many times had Maurice been horseback riding before visiting Matt?\n", "text": "Let the number of times Maurice had been horseback riding before his visit be represented by x.\n\nDuring the two weeks, Maurice and Matt rode together 8 times, and Matt rode an additional 16 times on his own. So in total, Matt rode 8 + 16 = <<8+16=24>>24 times.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of times Matt rode during that two weeks is three times the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit. So we have the equation 24 = 3x.\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8.\n\nTherefore, Maurice had been horseback riding 8 times before visiting Matt.

In one show, Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes.  Then, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.  And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nPolly stands for three times as long as Pulsar, for 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nPetra stands for one-sixth as long as Polly, which is 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 minutes.\nThus, the total time for all three entertainers is 10+30+5=<<10+30+5=45>>45 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{45}.\n\n\nQuestion: Matthew, Patrick and Alvin are eating dinner together. Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick eats. Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats. If Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, how many did Matthew eat?\n\nIf Patrick ate half as many egg rolls as Alvin, since Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, Patrick ate 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 egg rolls.\nMatthew ate three times as many egg rolls as Patrick, a total of 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 egg rolls. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Yesterday, the newly opened animal shelter received their first 60 animals. They got 20 more cats than dogs. How many cats did they take in?\n", "text": "Let's let the number of dogs be represented by the variable $d$. Since there were 20 more cats than dogs, the number of cats can be represented by $d + 20$. The total number of animals is the sum of the number of dogs and the number of cats, which is $d + (d + 20) = 2d + 20$. We know that this total is 60, so we can set up the equation $2d + 20 = 60$. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives $2d = 40$, and dividing both sides by 2 gives $d = 20$. Since there were 20 dogs, the number of cats is $20 + 20 = 40$. \n\nAnswer: There were \\boxed{40} cats."}
