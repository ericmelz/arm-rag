If Jerry doesn't make any payments, how much (in dollars) does the loan shark charge in interest the second month?\n\nTo calculate the interest charged the second month, we need to find 10% of Jerry's initial loan of $200 first, which is 0.10 * $200 = $<<0.10*200=20>>20.\nSince the interest is compounded monthly, we then add this interest amount to Jerry's loan, giving us a new total of $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=220>>220.\nTo find the interest charged the second month, we calculate 10% of $220, which is 0.10 * $220 = $<<0.10*220=22>>22.
