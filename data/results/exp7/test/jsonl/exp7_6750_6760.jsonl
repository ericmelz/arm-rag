Answer: \\boxed{900}.\n\n\nQuestion: 55% of Toby's friends are boys and the rest are girls. If he has 33 friends who are boys, how many friends does he have who are girls?\n\nIf 55% of Toby's friends are boys, then the percentage of his friends who are girls is 100% - 55% = 45%.\nIf 33 friends are boys, then 33/0.55 = <<33/0.55=60>>60 friends represent 45% in total.\nHence, Toby has 60 - 33 = <<60-33=27>>27 friends who are girls. Answer: \\boxed{27}.\n\n\nQuestion: Megan has read 32 books this year.  Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read.

She watches 35 minutes before she realizes she needs to rewind the movie to catch something she missed, a process that adds 5 minutes to her total viewing time. She watches the movie for another 45 minutes but has to rewind it again, adding 15 minutes to her total time. Finally, she watches the last 20 minutes uninterrupted. If she added up the duration of the film plus all the times she had to rewind and re-watch parts, how many minutes did it take her to watch the movie?\n", "text": "Amaya watches the movie for 35 minutes, then rewinds it for 5 minutes, and watches it again for 45 minutes before rewinding it for 15 minutes.
