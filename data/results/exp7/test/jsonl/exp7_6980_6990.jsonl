So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed.

He pepper-sprays some raccoons and 6 times as many squirrels. If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12.

The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?\n\nFirst find the proportion of the eggs that are blue: 4/5 * 100% = 80%\nThen find the proportion of the eggs that are purple: 1/5 * 100% = 20%\nThen find the proportion of the purple eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are purple: 1/2 * 1/5 = 1/10\nThen find the proportion of the blue eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are blue: 1/4 * 4/5 = 1/5\nThen add the proportion of purple eggs with 5 pieces of candy to the proportion of blue eggs with 5 pieces of candy to find the overall proportion with 5 pieces: 1/10 + 1/5 = 1/10 + 2/10 = 3/10\nThen multiply the proportion of eggs with 5 pieces by 100% to find the percentage chance of getting a blue egg with 5 pieces: 3/10 * 100% = 30%.

If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet s be the number of squirrels Jason pepper-sprays and r be the number of raccoons. We know that s = 6r and s + r = 84.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 6r + r = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7r = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get r = 12.
