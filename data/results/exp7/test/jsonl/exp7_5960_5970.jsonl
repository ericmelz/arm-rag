They had a bucket of 30 candies, and all of them ate until they cried. If they divide the remaining candies in the bucket equally, how many sourball candies will they each get?\n\nJacob can only eat 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 sourball candies before crying.\nLana can only eat 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 sourball candies before crying.\nTogether, they all managed to eat 12 + 6 + 3 = <<12+6+3=21>>21 sourball candies.\nSo, they divide the 30 - 21 = <<30-21=9>>9 remaining candies equally.\nTherefore, each of them will get 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 sourball candies. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Candace decides to enter a race. The race is run in 4 segments, with racers eliminated at the end of each segment. 10 racers are eliminated after the first segment. A third of the remaining racers are eliminated after the next section. Half of the remaining racers are eliminated before the last leg of the race. If 100 racers started the race, how many will run in the final section of the race?\n", "text": "After the first segment, there are 100 - 10 = <<100-10=90>>90 racers remaining.\nAfter the second segment, a third of the remaining racers are eliminated, which is (1/3)*90 = <<(1/3)*90=30>>30 racers.\nSo, there are now 90 - 30 = <<90-30=60>>60 racers remaining.\nAfter the third segment, half of the remaining racers are eliminated, which is (1/2)*60 = <<(1/2)*60=30>>30 racers.\nTherefore, there will be 60 - 30 = <<60-30=30>>30 racers running in the final section of the race. Answer: \\boxed{30}."}
