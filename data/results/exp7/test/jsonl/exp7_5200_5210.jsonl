Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nJustine initially had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, so let's assume Bailey had x rubber bands.\nSo, Justine had x + 10 rubber bands.\nJustine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, so Ylona had x + 10 + 2 = x + 12 rubber bands.\nBailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona so he had x - 2 - 2 = x - 4 rubber bands.\nSince Bailey is left with 8 rubber bands, we have x - 4 = 8.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get x = 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nSo Ylona initially had x + 12 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 rubber bands. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: Geric had twice as many bills as Kyla who has 2 fewer bills than Jessa.  After giving 3 bills to Geric, Jessa has 7 bills left. How many bills did Geric have at the beginning?\n", "text": "Let x be the number of bills that Jessa had at the beginning.\nKyla had 2 fewer bills than Jessa, so Kyla had x - 2 bills.\nGeric had twice as many bills as Kyla, so Geric had 2 * (x - 2) = 2x - 4 bills.\nAfter giving 3 bills to Geric, Jessa has 7 bills left, so she initially had 7 + 3 = 10 bills.\nTherefore, x = 10.\nSubstituting x = 10 into the equation for Geric, we get Geric had 2(10) - 4 = 20 - 4 = <<2*10-4=16>>16 bills at the beginning.

Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bob runs 6 miles per hour. His friend Jim runs at 9 miles per hour. If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?\n\nBob has a head-start of 1 mile, which means he is 1 mile ahead of Jim when they start running.\nThe difference in their speeds is 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 miles per hour.\nSo, it will take Jim 1 / 3 = <<1/3=0.3333333333333333>>0.33333 hours to catch up to Bob.\nTherefore, it will take Jim 0.33333 x 60 = <<0.33333*60=19.9998>>19.9998 minutes to catch up to Bob.\nHence, it will take Jim approximately 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\n\nHalf of what Richard walks the first day is 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 miles.\nThe second day Richard walks 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 miles.\nSo in two days he walks 20+4=<<20+4=24>>24 miles.\nTo get to New York City Richard needs to walk 70-24-10=<<70-24-10=36>>36 more miles.

If his daily goal is 10,000 steps, how many minutes will it take him to reach his goal?\n\nHe walks 2000 steps in 30 minutes and his goal is 10,000 steps. This means he walks 10000/2000 = <<10000/2000=5>>5 times his goal\nIt takes him 30 minutes to reach 2000 steps and he does this 5 times so it will take him 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes.

There are 25 more adults than children. How many children are in the group?\n", "text": "Let's assume the number of children in the group is x. \n\nSince there are 25 more adults than children, the number of adults in the group is x + 25. \n\nThe total amount paid for adult tickets is ($15) * (x + 25). \n\nThe total amount paid for child tickets is ($8) * x. \n\nAccording to the problem, the total amount the group paid is $720. \n\nSo we can write the equation: ($15) * (x + 25) + ($8) * x = $720. \n\nExpanding the equation: 15x + 375 + 8x = 720. \n\nCombining like terms: 23x + 375 = 720. \n\nSubtracting 375 from both sides: 23x = 345. \n\nDividing both sides by 23: x = 15. \n\nTherefore, there are 15 children in the group. Answer: \\boxed{15}."}
