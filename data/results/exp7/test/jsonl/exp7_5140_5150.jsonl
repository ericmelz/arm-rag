Her fourth class has half as many as her first class. Her fifth and sixth classes have 28 students. How many students does Monica see each day?\n", "text": "In Monica's first class, she has 20 students.\nIn her second and third classes, she has 25 students each. So in total, she has 20 + 25 + 25 = 70 students.\nHer fourth class has half as many students as her first class, so it has 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.\nIn her fifth and sixth classes, she has 28 students each.
