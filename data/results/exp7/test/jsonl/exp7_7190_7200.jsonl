If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, so it crumples $42/7 = 6$ pages. The printer blurs every third page, so it blurs $42/3 = 14$ pages. However, every seventh page is both crumpled and blurred, so we must subtract these cases off to avoid double-counting. Thus, James has $42-6-14 + 2 = \\boxed{24}$ pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.\n\n\nQuestion: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.
