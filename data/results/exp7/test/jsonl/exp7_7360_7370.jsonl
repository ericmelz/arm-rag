What is the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped?\n\nThe total number of striped nails is 20 - 6 - 8 = <<20-6-8=6>>6.\nThe percentage of striped nails is 6/20 * 100% = 30%.\nThe difference between the percentage of blue nails and striped nails is 8/20 * 100% - 30% = 40% - 30% = <<8/20*100%-30%=10>>10%. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Pulsar, the shuffle-dancing bear, Polly, the pink prancing poodle, and Petra, the proud portly pachyderm, are entertainers at the Big Top Circus.  In one show, Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes.  Then, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.  And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nPolly stands for three times as long as Pulsar, for 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nPetra stands for one-sixth as long as Polly, which is 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 minutes.\nThus, the total time for all three entertainers is 10+30+5=<<10+30+5=45>>45 minutes.

Fifteen more than a quarter of the number is x/4 + 15. We can set up the equation x/4 + 15 = 27 and solve for x. \n\nSubtracting 15 from both sides of the equation gives x/4 = 27 - 15 = 12. \n\nTo isolate x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4: (x/4) * 4 = 12 * 4. \n\nThis simplifies to x = 48. \n\nTherefore, the number is 48.
