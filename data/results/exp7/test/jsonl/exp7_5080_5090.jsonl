She gets a 12% commission on all items she sells. This month, she sold $24000 worth of items. Sixty percent of all her earning will be allocated to her personal needs and the rest will be saved.  How much did she save this month?\n\nThe commission she gets is 12/100*$24,000 = $<<12/100*24000=2880>>2880.\nThe amount of money allocated for personal needs is 2880*60/100 = $<<2880*60/100=1728>>1728.\nTherefore, the amount that was saved is $2880-$1728 = $<<2880-1728=1152>>1152.

If she realizes a $120 profit on her sales, how many people have she sold the books to if each book costs $5 to make and every customer buys 2 at a time?\n\nIf each book costs $5 to make, she earns $20 for each book she sells, so she makes a profit of $20-$5 = $<<20-5=15>>15 for each book.\nSince a profit of $120 was made, this means she sold $120/$15 = <<120/15=8>>8 books.\nSince every customer buys 2 books at a time, this means she sold a book to 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 people.

Paula buys two bracelets and a keychain, while Olive buys a coloring book and a bracelet.  How much do Paula and Olive spend in total?\n\nTwo bracelets cost 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nSo Paula spends $8 + $5 = $<<8+5=13>>13.\nWhile Olive spends $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7>>7.\nTherefore, Paula and Olive spend $13 + $7 = $<<13+7=20>>20 in total.
