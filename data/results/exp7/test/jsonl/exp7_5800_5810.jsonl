Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands.

Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nJustine initially had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, so let's assume Bailey had x rubber bands.\nSo, Justine had x + 10 rubber bands.\nJustine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, so Ylona had x + 10 + 2 = x + 12 rubber bands.\nBailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona so he had x - 2 - 2 = x - 4 rubber bands.\nSince Bailey is left with 8 rubber bands, we have x - 4 = 8.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get x = 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nSo Ylona initially had x + 12 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 rubber bands.

The first question was whether they prefer dogs or cats, and the second question was whether they movies or video games.  Of the 30 students in her class, 50% chose dogs and video games as their two answers, while 10% chose dogs and movies as their two answers.  In total, how many students in this teacher's class prefer dogs over cats?\n\nIf 50% of students chose dogs and video games, and 10% of students chose dogs and movies, then if we want the total percentage of students that prefer dogs over cats, we can just add these two percentages: 50% + 10% = 60% of students prefer dogs.\nSince 30 students are in the class, then to find the number of students that prefer dogs, we just multiply 60/100 * 30 = <<60/100*30=18>>18 students. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: It takes Emmalyn and her research team, the Polar Bears, 30 minutes to fully navigate around a volcanic island. On Saturday, they decided to start off by rounding the island once. They then re-grouped and planned out the rest of their weekend research schedule. They completed 10 more round that day and then went home. When they came on Sunday, they were able to complete 15 rounds. Calculate the total time, in minutes, the Polar Bears spent circling the island over that weekend.\n", "text": "On Saturday, the Polar Bears completed 1 initial round + 10 additional rounds = <<1+10=11>>11 rounds.\nOn Sunday, the Polar Bears completed 15 rounds.\nSo, over the weekend, they completed a total of 11 + 15 = <<11+15=26>>26 rounds.\nSince each round takes 30 minutes, the total time spent circling the island is 26 rounds * 30 minutes per round = <<26*30=780>>780 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{780}."}

She likes to hunt for treasure on the ocean's floor, but when she finds something to keep, she must carry it back to the surface of the water to give it to her shipmate on the boat.  She can only carry 3 objects at a time while she swims underwater.  If she finds 17 objects underwater, what is the fewest number of trips to the surface of the water she must take to carry all 17 objects to the boat?\n\nSince she can only carry 3 objects at a time, she needs to make 17/3 = <<17/3=5.666666666666667>>5.67 trips to the surface.\nSince she cannot make a partial trip, the fewest number of trips is 6. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Micah, Dean, and Jake are all training for a marathon organized by a local NGO to support children in their town who have cancer. Micah runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean. It takes Jake 1/3 times more time to finish the marathon than it takes Mica. If Dean takes 9 hours, what's the total time the three take to complete the marathon?\n\nMicah runs 2/3 times as fast as Dean, meaning Micah takes (2/3)*9 = <<2/3*9=6>>6 hours\nIt takes Jake 1/3 times more time to finish the marathon than Micah, meaning Jake takes 6+1/3*6 = <<6+1/3*6=8>>8 hours\nAltogether, the three take 6+9+8 = <<6+9+8=23>>23 hours. Answer: \\boxed{23}.\n\n\nQuestion: Micah, Dean, and Jake are all training for a marathon organized by a local NGO to support children in their town who have cancer.

How many hours does he have left to take a nap?\n\nHe spent 2+1+3=<<2+1+3=6>>6 hours on other activities.\nThus, Bret took a 9-6=<<9-6=3>>3 hour nap. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lexie is 6 years older than her brother and her sister is twice her age. If Lexie is 8, what is the age difference between her brother and her sister?\n\nIf Lexie is 8 years old, her brother is 8-6 = <<8-6=2>>2 years old.\nLexie's sister is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.\nThe age difference between Lexie's sister and brother is 16-2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years. Answer: \\boxed{14}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lilly and Fiona are cleaning a room. Between them, it takes 8 hours to clean the room. A quarter of the time spent cleaning was by Lilly and Fiona was responsible for the rest of the cleaning. How long, in minutes, was Fiona cleaning?\n", "text": "If it takes 8 hours to clean the room, and a quarter of the time was spent by Lilly, then Lilly spent 8/4 = 2 hours cleaning.\nThe rest of the time, which is 8-2 = 6 hours, was spent by Fiona.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, Fiona spent 6*60 = <<6*60=360>>360 minutes cleaning. Answer: \\boxed{360}."}
