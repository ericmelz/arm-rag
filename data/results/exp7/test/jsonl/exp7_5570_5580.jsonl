He can sell the sweet ones for $.5 an apple. The sour ones sell for $.1 an apple. 75% of the apples he gets are sweet and the rest are sour. If he earns $40, how many apples did his trees give him?\n\nThe sour apples made up 100%-75% = 25% of the total.\nThe sour apples were $.1 each so the sweet apples were worth $.4 each because .1 / .25 = <<.1/.25=.4>>.4\nHe sold 100 apples because 40 / .4 = <<40/.4=100>>100\nHe got 30 sour apples because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25\nHe got 70 sweet apples because 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75\nHis trees created 100 apples because 30 + 70 = <<100=100>>100.
