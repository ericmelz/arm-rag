How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\n", "text": "Let's first find the change in elevation. John's elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet, so the change in elevation is 1450 - 100 = 1350 feet. \n\nSince he moves 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally, the ratio of vertical distance to horizontal distance is 1:2. \n\nTo find the horizontal distance, we can set up the equation 1/2 = 1350/x, where x represents the horizontal distance. \n\nCross multiplying, we get 2 * 1350 = x, which simplifies to x = 2700. \n\nTherefore, John moves 2700 feet horizontally.

What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?\n\nIf Keaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times, he climbed a total of 30*20=<<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nIn inches, this is equal to 12*600 = <<12*600=7200>>7200 inches.\nReece climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's, which is 30-4 = 26 feet.\nIf he climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 26*15 =<<26*15=390>>390 feet.\nIn inches, this is equal to 12*390 = <<12*390=4680>>4680 inches.\nTogether, the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed is 7200+4680 = <<7200+4680=11880>>11880 inches. Answer: \\boxed{11880}.\n\n\nQuestion: Evergreen Elementary school has 100 students in Grades 4, 5, and 6. There are 30 students in Grade 4 and 35 students in Grade 5.
