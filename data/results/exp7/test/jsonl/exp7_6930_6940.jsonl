How much does a stuffed animal cost?\n\nThe two coloring books amounted to 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nFour packs of peanuts amounted to 4 x $1.50 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6.\nSo, the total amount she spent for the coloring books and the peanuts was $8 + $6 = $<<8+6=14>>14.\nTherefore, a stuffed animal cost $25 - $14 = $<<25-14=11>>11. Answer: \\boxed{11}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bob buys nose spray.  He buys 10 of them for a \"buy one get one free\" promotion.  They each cost $3.

If candies cost 20 cents apiece and Jake's feeding allowance is $4, how many candies can his friend purchase with the money Jake gave to him?\n\nJake gave to his friend 1/4*$4 = $<<1/4*4=1>>1.\nTherefore Jake's friend can purchase $1/$0.20 = <<1/0.20=5>>5 candies. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: The price of two kilograms of sugar and five kilograms of salt is $5.50. If a kilogram of sugar costs $1.50, then how much is the price of three kilograms of sugar and a kilogram of salt?\n", "text": "Let's find the total price of two kilograms of sugar and five kilograms of salt. Since a kilogram of sugar costs $1.50, the total price of two kilograms of sugar is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. Let's assume the price of a kilogram of salt is x. The total price of five kilograms of salt is 5x. Therefore, the total price of the two kilograms of sugar and five kilograms of salt is $3.00 + 5x. We know that this total price is $5.50. So, we can write the equation $3.00 + 5x = $5.50. \n\nNow, let's solve this equation for x. Subtracting $3.00 from both sides, we get 5x = $5.50 - $3.00 = $2.50. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = $2.50 / 5 = $0.50.\n\nNow, we need to find the price of three kilograms of sugar and a kilogram of salt. Since a kilogram of sugar costs $1.50, the total price of three kilograms of sugar is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. The price of a kilogram of salt is $0.50. Therefore, the total price of three kilograms of sugar and a kilogram of salt is $4.50 + $0.50 = $<<4.5+0.5=5>>5. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}

Between each station, there are 6 miles, and it takes 25 minutes to travel between them. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. How many minutes will it take to deliver all the cars?\n", "text": "The train starts with 6 coal cars, 12 iron cars, and 2 wood cars. At each station, the train can deposit up to 2 coal cars, 3 iron cars, and 1 wood car. To determine the total number of stations needed, we divide the number of cars by the number of cars that can be deposited at each station.\n\nFor coal cars, since 2 can be deposited at each station and there are initially 6 coal cars, it will take 6 / 2 = 3 stations to deliver all the coal cars.\nFor iron cars, since 3 can be deposited at each station and there are initially 12 iron cars, it will take 12 / 3 = 4 stations to deliver all the iron cars.\nFor wood cars, since 1 can be deposited at each station and there are initially 2 wood cars, it will take 2 / 1 = 2 stations to deliver all the wood cars.\n\nThe number of stations needed to deliver all the cars is the maximum of the stations required for each type of car, so the train will make a total of max(3, 4, 2) = 4 stations.\n\nSince it takes 25 minutes to travel between each station, the total time needed to deliver all the cars is 4 stations * 25 minutes = 100 minutes.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{100}."}
