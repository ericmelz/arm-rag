If each piece of Snickers costs $1.5 and a pack of M&M's has the same cost as 2 Snickers, how much is Julia's change if she gave the cashier 2 $10 bills?\n\nTwo pieces of snickers amount to $1.5 x 2 = $<<1.5*2=3>>3.\nJulia bought 3 packs of M&M's which amount to $3 x 3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.\nAnd the total amount she needs to pay is $3 + $9 = $<<3+9=12>>12.\nJulia gave the cashier 2 $10 bills, so her 2 x $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20.\nTherefore her change is $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Toby\u2019s father gave him $343 for passing the test. Toby decided to share it with his two brothers, so he gave each of them 1/7 of $343. How many dollars are left for Toby?\n\nEach brother received 1/7 * $343 = $<<343*1/7=49>>49.\nSo Toby gave a total of 2 * $49 = $<<2*49=98>>98 to his brothers.\nTherefore, Toby has $343 - $98 = $<<343-98=245>>245 left. Answer: \\boxed{245}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jake is from a conservative household so during lunch at school one day, he gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance to a hungry friend. If candies cost 20 cents apiece and Jake's feeding allowance is $4, how many candies can his friend purchase with the money Jake gave to him?\n\nJake gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance, which is $4 * (1/4) = $<<4*(1/4)=1>>1.\nJake's friend can purchase $1 / $0.20/candy = <<1/0.2=5>>5 candies.
