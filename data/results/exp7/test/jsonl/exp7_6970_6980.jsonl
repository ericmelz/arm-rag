If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, which means it crumples 42 / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages.\nThe printer blurs the ink on every third page, which means it blurs 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages.\nHowever, some pages are both crumpled and blurred, so we need to subtract these from the total. This is because the crumpled pages are a multiple of 7, and the blurred pages are a multiple of 3, thus the multiples of the lowest common multiple are the duplicates. The printer crumples and blurs on every 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pages.\nThus, we must subtract the pages that are both crumpled and blurred, which is 42 / 21 = <<42/21=2>>2 pages.\nSo in total, he has 42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.

The printer blurs every third page, so it blurs $42/3 = 14$ pages. However, every seventh page is both crumpled and blurred, so we must subtract these cases off to avoid double-counting.

She gave a sixth of the baby mice to her friend Robbie to keep as pets. She sold three times the number of babies she gave Robbie to a pet store. Half of the remaining mice were sold to snake owners as feeder mice. How many baby mice did Brenda have left?\n\nBrenda has a total of 3 x 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 baby mice.\nBrenda gave Robbie 24 / 6 = <<24/6=4>>4 baby mice.\nBrenda sold 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 baby mice to the pet store.\nThis means that Brenda was left with 24 - 4 - 12 = <<24-4-12=8>>8 baby mice.\nHalf of these were sold to snake owners, so Brenda has 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 baby mice left.

Then each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to the stress of overcrowding. How many mice are left?\n\nFirst find the number of pups after the first generation of breeding: 8 mice * 6 pups/mouse = <<8*6=48>>48 pups\nThen add that number to the number of adult mice to find the total number of mice before the second generation of breeding: 48 pups + 8 mice = <<48+8=56>>56 mice\nThen find the number of pups after the second generation of breeding by multiplying the number of mice by the number of pups/mouse: 56 mice * 6 pups/mice = <<56*6=336>>336 pups\nThen subtract the number of pups the adults eat: 336 pups - 56 mice * 2 pups/mice = 336 pups - 112 pups = <<336-112=224>>224 pups\nThen add up the number of adult mice to find the total number of mice left: 224 pups + 56 mice = <<224+56=280>>280 mice.

Each wolf needs to eat 8 pounds of meat a day and the wolves won't hunt again for five days. If each deer contains 200 pounds of meat, how many deer does each wolf need to kill?\n", "text": "First find the total number of wolves: 4 wolves + 16 wolves = <<4+16=20>>20 wolves\nThen multiply that number by the number of pounds each wolf needs to eat to find the total amount of meat needed: 20 wolves * 8 pounds/wolf = <<20*8=160>>160 pounds\nThen divide that amount by the amount of meat each deer has to find the number of deer needed: 160 pounds / 200 pounds/deer = <<160/200=0.8>>0.8 deer\nSince you can't have a fraction of a deer, the wolves need to kill 1 deer per wolf. Answer: \\boxed{1}."}
