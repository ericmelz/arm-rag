He leaves the house to go to the city center. After he walks 200 meters he realizes that he forgot his bag. So he returns to his house, then goes back to the city center. How many meters does he walk in total?\n\nRobin walks a total of 200 meters to go back to his house + 200 meters to the city center = <<200+200=400>>400 meters.\nSo, Robin walks a total of 500 meters to go back to his house + 400 meters going from his house to the city center = <<500+400=900>>900 meters. Answer: \\boxed{900}.\n\n\nQuestion: Kristine traveled to Paris in France to visit her friend. On the way, she has driven a train for 300 km and a bus for half that distance. After arriving in the city, she had to take a cab and drove three times fewer kilometers than she rode the bus. How many kilometers in total had Kristine traveled to reach her destination?\n\nKristine drove half the distance the train went, so 300 km / 2 = <<300/2=150>>150 km by bus.\nShe drove 3 times fewer kilometers than she rode the bus, so the cab ride was 150 km / 3 = <<150/3=50>>50 km.\nHer total distance is 300 km + 150 km + 50 km = <<300+150+50=500>>500 km. Answer: \\boxed{500}.\n\n\nQuestion: On the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\n\nThe ship sailed halfway to the destination, so the total distance for the whole journey is 2 * (1/2) = <<2*(1/2)=1>>1.\nThe ship was blown one-third of the way to the destination, so the distance blown is 1 * (1/3) = <<1*(1/3)=0.3333333333333333>>0.3333333333333333 of the total distance.\nThe distance blown in kilometers is therefore 0.3333333333333333 * 30 * 20 = <<0.3333333333333333*30*20=199.99999999999997>>199.99999999999997.

After arriving in the city, she had to take a cab and drove three times fewer kilometers than she rode the bus. How many kilometers in total had Kristine traveled to reach her destination?\n\nKristine traveled half the distance she drove a train, which is 300 km / 2 = <<300/2=150>>150 km on a bus.\nThe distance she drove by cab was 3 times fewer than the distance she drove a bus, so she travelled 150 km / 3 = <<150/3=50>>50 km by cab.\nSo in total Kristine had traveled a distance of 300 km + 150 km + 50 km = <<300+150+50=500>>500 km. Answer: \\boxed{500}.\n\n\nQuestion: Albert noticed a flock of geese flying together in a V formation in the sky overhead.  One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees.  Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky.  If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?\n\nLet X be the number of geese in the first formation.\nThe number of geese that break off is X/2.\nThe number of geese that remain flying is X - X/2 = X/2.\nThe number of geese that join the formation later is 4.\nThe final number of geese in the formation is (X/2) + 4 = 12.\nThen (X/2) = 12 - 4 = 8\nThen X = 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: A plane flies between 4 cities; A, B, C and D. Passengers board and alight at each airport in every city when it departs and lands, respectively.  The distance between city A and city B is 100 miles.  The distance between city B and city C is 50 miles more than the distance between city A and city B.  The distance between city C and city D is twice the distance between city B and city C. Calculate the total distance between city A and city D.\n", "text": "The distance between city B and city C is 100 miles + 50 miles = <<100+50=150>>150 miles.\nThe distance between city C and city D is 150 miles * 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 miles.\nThe total distance between city A and city D is 100 miles + 150 miles + 300 miles = <<100+150+300=550>>550 miles.
