He sells 10 Reubens and 5 Pastrami sandwiches and earns $55. How much does a pastrami sandwich cost?\n", "text": "Let's assume that the cost of a Reuben sandwich is $x. Then, the cost of a pastrami sandwich would be $x + $2, since pastrami costs $2 more than the Reuben.\n\nReuben sells 10 Reubens, so he earns 10 * $x = $10x from the Reubens.\n\nHe also sells 5 pastrami sandwiches, so he earns 5 * ($x + $2) = $5x + $10 from the pastrami sandwiches.\n\nIn total, Reuben earns $10x + $5x + $10 = $15x + $10 from both types of sandwiches.\n\nSince he earns $55 in total, we can set up the equation: $15x + $10 = $55.\n\nSubtracting $10 from both sides gives us $15x = $45.\n\nDividing both sides by $15 gives us x = $<<45/15=3>>3.\n\nTherefore, the cost of a Reuben sandwich is $3, and the cost of a pastrami sandwich (which is $2 more than the Reuben) is $3 + $2 = $5.
