If the Magnet cost $3, how much, in dollars, did a single stuffed animal cost?\n\nThe magnet cost three times more than the sticker, so the sticker cost $3 / 3 = $<<3/3=1>>1.\nThe magnet cost one quarter the price of both stuffed animals combined, so the two stuffed animals cost $3 x 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nIf the two stuffed animals together cost $12, then a single stuffed animal cost $12 / 2 = $<<12/2=6>>6.

Mr. and Mrs. Martin each get the regular scoop.  Their two children each get the kiddie scoop.  Their three teenage children each get double scoops.  How much money does Mrs. Martin pay the cashier?\n", "text": "Mr. and Mrs. Martin each get a regular scoop, which costs $4 each, so that's a total of 2 * $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nTheir two children each get a kiddie scoop, which costs $3 each, so that's a total of 2 * $3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nTheir three teenage children each get a double scoop, which costs $6 each, so that's a total of 3 * $6 = $<<3*6=18>>18.\nSo Mrs. Martin pays a total of $8 + $6 + $18 = $<<8+6+18=32>>32.

The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes. Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby rotates 400 baseballs because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend rotates 404 apples because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nHis friend wins because 404 > 400.\nThe winner rotates 404 objects. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jillian had 80 oranges which she had bought to give to her friends. She divided each orange into ten equal pieces for each friend to get four pieces. How many friends were there?\n\nJillian has a total of 80 * 10 = <<80*10=800>>800 equal pieces of oranges.\nThus she had 800 / 4 = <<800/4=200>>200 friends.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations.
