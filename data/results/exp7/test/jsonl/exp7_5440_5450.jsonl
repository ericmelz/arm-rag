Once the water reaches 212 degrees and is boiling, Jason needs to cook his pasta for 12 minutes. Then it will take him 1/3 that long to mix the pasta with the sauce and make a salad. How many minutes does it take Jason to cook dinner?\n", "text": "It takes 212 - 41 = <<212-41=171>>171 degrees to raise the temperature of the water to boiling.\nSince the temperature of the water increases by 3 degrees every minute, it takes 171 / 3 = <<171/3=57>>57 minutes to reach boiling point.\nAfter the water reaches boiling, Jason needs to cook the pasta for 12 minutes, so in total, it takes 57 + 12 = <<57+12=69>>69 minutes to cook the pasta.\nTo mix the pasta with sauce and make a salad, it takes 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 minutes.\nTherefore, it takes Jason a total of 69 + 4 = <<69+4=73>>73 minutes to cook dinner. Answer: \\boxed{73}."}

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Yun had 20 paperclips initially, but then lost 12. Marion has 1/4 more than what Yun currently has, plus 7. How many paperclips does Marion have?\n\nYun has 20 - 12 = <<20-12=8>>8 paperclips.\nThen, Marion has (1/4) x 8 + 7 = <<(1/4)*8+7=9>>9 paperclips.
