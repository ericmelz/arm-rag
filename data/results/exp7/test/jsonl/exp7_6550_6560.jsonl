Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?\n\nIf Keaton climbed a ladder twenty times, climbing 30 feet each time, his total is 20*30 = <<20*30=600>>600 feet.\nReece, climbing a 4 feet shorter ladder fifteen times, climbs a total of 15*(30-4) = <<15*(30-4)=390>>390 feet.\nConverting Keaton's Climb to inches gives 600*12 = <<600*12=7200>>7200 inches\nSimilarly, Reece's climb in inches is 390*12 = <<390*12=4680>>4680 inches.\nTogether, Reece and Keaton climbed 4680+7200 = <<4680+7200=11880>>11880 inches.

How many times does she fill it to complete the measurements?\n\nTo measure 2 cups of flour, Felicia fills the scoop 8 times because 2 / (1/4) = 8\nShe fills the scoop 4 times with white sugar because 1 / (1/4) = <<1/(1/4)=4>>4\nShe fills the cup 2 times with oil because (1/2) / (1/4) = <<(1/2)/(1/4)=2>>2\nShe fills the scoop 1 time with brown sugar because (1/4) / (1/4) = 1\nOverall, she fills the scoop 15 times because 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = <<8+4+2+1=15>>15. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Martine has 6 more than twice as many peaches as Benjy. Benjy has one-third as many peaches as Gabrielle. If Martine has 16 peaches, how many does Gabrielle have?\n\nLet x be the number of peaches that Benjy has\nMartine has 6+2x peaches.\nWe know that 16=6+2x.\nThus we know that 2x=10 and x=<<5=5>>5\nLet y be the number of peaches that Gabrielle has\nThus 5=(1/3)y\n5*3=y\n15=y\nGabrielle has <<15=15>>15 peaches.

Six tiles are purple and the remaining tiles are white.  How many white tiles are there?\n", "text": "If there are 3 yellow tiles, then there are 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 blue tiles.\nThe total number of yellow and blue tiles is 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7.\nThere are 6 purple tiles, so the total number of yellow, blue, and purple tiles is 7 + 6 = <<7+6=13>>13.\nSince there are 20 tiles in total, the number of white tiles is 20 - 13 = <<20-13=7>>7.
