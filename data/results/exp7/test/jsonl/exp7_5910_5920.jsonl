The scientist, eager to use his new invention, looked through his house for something to shrink zap.  The first thing he found and zapped was his wife, who at the time was carrying a tray containing 5 cups filled with coffee.  If each coffee cup held 8 ounces of fluid before being zapped, how many ounces of coffee remained after his wife and the cups filled with coffee were shrink zapped?\n", "text": "If each coffee cup held 8 ounces of fluid before being zapped, then after being shrink zapped, each cup would contain 8 ounces * (1 - 0.5) = 4 ounces of coffee.\nSince there were 5 cups, the total amount of coffee remaining after shrinking would be 5 cups * 4 ounces per cup = 20 ounces.\nTherefore, after his wife and the cups filled with coffee were shrink zapped, there would be 20 ounces of coffee remaining.

It costs 90 cents to make each pop, and the money from the pops will be used to buy pencils, which cost $1.80 each. How many pops must be sold to buy 100 pencils?\n\nTo buy 100 pencils, the school needs 100 * $1.80 = $<<100*1.80=180>>180.\nEach pop generates $1.50 - $0.90 = $<<1.50-0.90=0.60>>0.60.\nThus, $180 / $0.60 per pop = <<180/0.60=300>>300 pops must be sold.

It costs 90 cents to make each pop, and the money from the pops will be used to buy pencils, which cost $1.80 each. How many pops must be sold to buy 100 pencils?\n\nThe total cost to buy 100 pencils is 100 * 1.80 = $<<100*1.8=180>>180.\nEach pop sells for $1.50 and costs 90 cents to make, so each pop earns a profit of 1.50 - 0.90 = $<<1.50-0.90=0.60>>0.60.\nThus, 180 / 0.60 = <<180/0.60=300>>300 ice-pops must be sold to buy 100 pencils.

When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute.  But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute.  During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth.  During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?\n", "text": "The balloon rises at a rate of 50 feet per minute when the lift chain is pulled. Jo-Bob pulled the chain for a total of 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.\nTherefore, the balloon rises a total of 50 feet per minute * 30 minutes = <<50*30=1500>>1500 feet when the chain is pulled.\nDuring the 10 minutes when the chain is not pulled, the balloon descended at a rate of 10 feet per minute. Therefore, the balloon descended a total of 10 feet per minute * 10 minutes = <<10*10=100>>100 feet when the chain is not pulled.\nSo, the highest elevation reached by the balloon is 1500 feet - 100 feet = <<1500-100=1400>>1400 feet. Answer: \\boxed{1400}."}

There are 10 boys in the class and each boy today brought 5 cups for science activity class as Ms. Leech had instructed. If the total number of cups brought by the students in the class is 90, how many cups did each girl bring?\n\nTwice the number of boys in the class is 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20\nThe number of boys and girls in the class is 20+10 = <<20+10=30>>30\nThe girls in the class are 30 boys and girls - 10 boys = <<30-10=20>>20 girls.\nThe total number of cups brought by the boys in the class is 10 boys * 5 cups = <<10*5=50>>50 cups.\nThe population of the cups is 90 cups\nIf the total number of cups brought by all students in the class is 90 cups, then the total number of cups brought by the girls is 90 cups-50 cups = <<90-50=40>>40 cups.\nSince the number of girls in the class is 20, the number of cups each girl brought is 40 cups/20 girls = <<40/20=2>>2 cups.
