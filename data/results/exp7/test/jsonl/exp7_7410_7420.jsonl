Answer: \\boxed{35}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n\nThere are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple plants than yellow ones.\nThat means there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.\nSo, there are 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 yellow and purple plants in total.\nThat means there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.\nSo in total, Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 flowers. Answer: \\boxed{35}.\n\n\nQuestion: A garden is filled with 105 flowers of various colors. There are twice as many red flowers as orange. There are five fewer yellow flowers than red. If there are 10 orange flowers, how many pink and purple flowers are there if they have the same amount and there are no other colors?\n\nThere are twice as many red flowers as orange, so there are 2 * 10 orange = <<2*10=20>>20 red flowers.\nThere are five fewer yellow flowers than red, so there are 20 red - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 yellow flowers.\nThere are 10 orange + 20 red + 15 yellow in total = <<10+20+15=45>>45 flowers whose colors we know.\nIf we subtract these from the total we know there are, then there are 105 flowers - 45 flowers = <<105-45=60>>60 pink and purple flowers combined.\nThus, there are 60 pink and purple flowers / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 flowers of each color. Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: Nadine collected different colored pebbles. She has 20 white pebbles and half as many red pebbles. How many pebbles does she have in all?\n\nNadine has half as many red pebbles as white pebbles, which means she has 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 red pebbles.\nThe total number of pebbles that Nadine has is 10+20 = <<10+20=30>>30 pebbles.

Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tapanga and Corey have 66 candies together. However, Tapanga has 8 more candies than Corey. How many candies does Corey have?\n", "text": "Let's assume Corey has x candies.\nTapanga has 8 more candies than Corey, so she has x + 8 candies.\nTogether, they have x + (x + 8) = 66 candies.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66.\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 29.\nTherefore, Corey has 29 candies. Answer: \\boxed{29}."}
