So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed.

If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?\n\nLet's assume that there were \"x\" lions in Londolozi at first.\nAfter 1 year, the number of lion cubs born is 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60.\nThe number of lions that died in a year is 1 * 12 = <<1*12=12>>12.\nSo, the number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year becomes \"x + 60 - 12 = 148.\"\nx + 48 = 148 is the equation representing the fact that the number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year is 148.\nThus, the number of lions in Londolozi at first is x = 148 - 48 = <<148-48=100>>100.
