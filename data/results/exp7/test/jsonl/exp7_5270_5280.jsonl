How many times did the poodle bark?\n\nSince the terrier\u2019s owner has to say \u201chush\u201d six times before the dogs stopped barking, the terrier must have barked 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times.\nSince the poodle barks twice for every one time the terrier barks, the poodle must have barked 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 times.

So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\n\nFirst find how many tulips Anna needs for both eyes: 8 tulips/eye * 2 eyes = <<8*2=16>>16 tulips\nThen find how many tulips Anna needs in total for the smile: 18 tulips/smile * 1 smile = <<18*1=18>>18 tulips\nThen multiply that number by the number of tulips in the smile to find the number of tulips in the yellow background: 18 tulips/smile * 9 tulips/smile = <<18*9=162>>162 tulips\nThen add the number of tulips in the eyes, the smile, and the background to find the total number of tulips: 162 tulips + 18 tulips + 16 tulips = <<162+18+16=196>>196 tulips. Answer: \\boxed{196}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jerry wakes up one morning and finds the thermostat set to 40 degrees. He set it to double the initial temperature. His dad notices, yells at Jerry, and reducing the temperature by 30 degrees. Later, Jerry's mother reduces the temperature by 30%, before his sister increases it by 24 degrees. What's the final temperature?\n\nJerry sets the thermostat to double the initial temperature, which means 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 degrees.\nHis dad reduces the temperature by 30 degrees, so 80 - 30 = <<80-30=50>>50 degrees.\nHis mother reduces the temperature by 30%, which means 50 - 0.3 * 50 = <<50-0.3*50=35>>35 degrees.\nHis sister increases the temperature by 24 degrees, which means 35 + 24 = <<35+24=59>>59 degrees.

While she is waiting for school to start on Monday she counts the tiles on the ceiling--38. While she is waiting for everyone to finish their tests after she has handed in hers, she counts the books in the room--75. On Tuesday Carla counts all the tiles twice in a row and she counts the books three times in a row when she has to wait for a long time for the teacher to finish handing out the graded tests. If every time Carla counts something counts as once, how many times has Carla counted something on Tuesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, Carla counts the tiles twice in a row, and the books three times in a row. So, she has counted the tiles 2 * 38 = <<2*38=76>>76 times.\nAnd she has counted the books 3 * 75 = <<3*75=225>>225 times.\nIn total, Carla has counted something 76 + 225 = <<76+225=301>>301 times on Tuesday.

Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lexie and Tom went apple picking. Lexie picked 12 apples and Tom picked twice as many apples. How many apples did they collect altogether?\n\nTom picked 12 apples * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 apples.\nAltogether, they picked 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 apples. Answer: \\boxed{36}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lexie and Tom went apple picking. Lexie picked 12 apples and Tom picked twice as many apples. How many apples did they collect altogether?\n\nTom picked twice as many apples as Lexie, which means he picked 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 apples.\nThe total number of apples they picked was 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 apples. Answer: \\boxed{36}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lexie and Tom went apple picking. Lexie picked 12 apples and Tom picked twice as many apples.

Matt got twice as many apples, and Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. How many fruits do the three children have in total?\n\nIf Mike received 3 oranges, the total number of oranges is 3 oranges.\nMatt got twice as many apples, a total of 2 * 3 oranges = <<2*3=6>>6 apples.\nThe total number of fruits that Mike and Matt got is 6 apples + 3 oranges = <<6+3=9>>9 fruits.\nMark received the same number of bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether, so he got 9 fruits.\nIn total, the three children have 9 fruits + 9 fruits = <<9+9=18>>18 fruits. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Isabel was helping her mom pick apples from their tree in the front yard.  Together they picked 34 apples.  They want to make apple pies.  Each apple pie needs 4 apples, but the apples have to be ripe.  6 of the apples they picked are not ripe.  How many pies can they make?\n", "text": "They picked 34 apples in total. Out of those, 6 are not ripe. So, they have 34 - 6 = <<34-6=28>>28 ripe apples.\nEach pie requires 4 apples, so they can make 28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7 apple pies. Answer: \\boxed{7}."}

They prepare coffee to help them stay focused. If Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivory, and Brayan drinks 4 cups of coffee in an hour, calculate the total number of cups of coffee they drink together in 5 hours.\n\nSince Brayan drinks twice as much coffee as Ivy, Ivory drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups of coffee in an hour, half the amount Brayan drinks\nTogether, they drink 2+4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of coffee in an hour to stay focused.\nThe total number of cups of coffee they would have taken after five hours is 6*5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cups.

If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nLet's start by finding out how many women are at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 guests is (40/100)*200 = <<(40/100)*200=80>>80 women.\nOut of the 80 women, 80% are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 women is (80/100)*80 = <<(80/100)*80=64>>64 women.\nNow let's find out how many men are at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200 and that 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 men.\nOut of the 120 men, 60% are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 men is (60/100)*120 = <<(60/100)*120=72>>72 men.\nThe total number of people wearing rabbit ears is 64 women + 72 men = <<64+72=136>>136 people.
