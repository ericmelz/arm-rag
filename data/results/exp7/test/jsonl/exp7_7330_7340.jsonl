In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?\n\nOf his 12 roaches, Calvin has half as many crickets, so he has 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 crickets.\nOf his 3 scorpions, he has twice as many caterpillars, so he has 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 caterpillars.\nThus, in total, Calvin has 12 roaches + 3 scorpions + 6 crickets + 6 caterpillars = <<12+3+6+6=27>>27 insects.

So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations.

After finding the perfect site, it took him 4 hours to dig up 8 feet of sand under which to bury the treasure.  Once the treasure was buried, he left the island.  Then, a tropical storm came and washed away half of the sand from on top of the treasure.  Next, a giant tsunami wave poured over the island, adding 2 feet of new sand back onto the site of his treasure. When Pirate Rick returned, how long did it take for him to dig up his treasure?\n", "text": "The treasure was buried under 8 feet of sand, which took 4 hours to dig up.\nHalf of the sand was washed away by the tropical storm, so 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 feet of sand remained on top of the treasure.\nA tsunami wave added 2 feet of new sand, so 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 feet of sand remained on top of the treasure.\nTo dig up the treasure, Pirate Rick had to dig up 6 feet of sand.\nSince it took him 4 hours to dig up 8 feet of sand, it would take him <<4*6/8=3>>3 hours to dig up 6 feet of sand.\nTherefore, it took Pirate Rick 3 hours to dig up his treasure.

If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\n\nFirst find how many tulips Anna needs for both eyes: 8 tulips/eye * 2 eyes = <<8*2=16>>16 tulips\nThen find how many tulips Anna needs in total for the smile: 18 tulips/smile * 1 smile = <<18*1=18>>18 tulips\nThen multiply that number by the number of tulips in the smile to find the number of tulips in the yellow background: 18 tulips/smile * 9 tulips/smile = <<18*9=162>>162 tulips\nThen add the number of tulips in the eyes, the smile, and the background to find the total number of tulips: 162 tulips + 18 tulips + 16 tulips = <<162+18+16=196>>196 tulips. Answer: \\boxed{196}.\n\n\nQuestion: A road has four intersections. At the first intersection, there are 40 road signs showing different types of information mounted on the street poles. At the second intersection, 1/4 times more road signs than the first intersection are mounted on the street poles. The number of road signs at the third intersection is twice the number at the second intersection. If at the fourth intersection the number of road signs is 20 fewer than those at the third intersection, calculate the total number of road signs at the four intersections.\n", "text": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. At the first intersection, there are 40 road signs.\n2. At the second intersection, there are 1/4 times more road signs than at the first intersection. This means there are (1 + 1/4) * 40 = 1.25 * 40 = 50 road signs at the second intersection.\n3. At the third intersection, there are twice the number of road signs at the second intersection. This means there are 2 * 50 = 100 road signs at the third intersection.\n4. At the fourth intersection, the number of road signs is 20 fewer than at the third intersection. This means there are 100 - 20 = 80 road signs at the fourth intersection.\n\nTo find the total number of road signs at the four intersections, we add up the number of road signs at each intersection:\n\n40 + 50 + 100 + 80 = 270\n\nTherefore, the total number of road signs at the four intersections is 270. Answer: \\boxed{270}."}
