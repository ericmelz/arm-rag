After how many hours will she be able to drink a total of 3 liters of water?\n", "text": "Sandy drinks 500 milliliters of water every 2 hours. To convert liters to milliliters, we know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. So, Sandy's goal of 3 liters is equal to 3 x 1000 = 3000 milliliters.\nSince Sandy drinks 500 milliliters every 2 hours, let's find out how many sets of 500 milliliters she needs to reach 3000 milliliters.\n3000 milliliters / 500 milliliters = 6 sets.\nTherefore, Sandy will be able to drink a total of 3 liters of water after 6 sets of 2 hours, which is a duration of 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.
