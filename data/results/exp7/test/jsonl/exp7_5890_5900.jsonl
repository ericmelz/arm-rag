He once played a three-letter word on a triple word score to earn thirty points.  If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?\n\nA triple word score tripled the score, so before it was worth thirty points, the score was triple the three-letter word score, or 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\nIf the first and third letters were each valued at one point, then the score from the first and third letters is 1+1=<<1+1=2>>2 points.\nThus, before the triple word score, the score from the middle letter was 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 points.

If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?\n\nWithout the triple word score bonus, the word was worth 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\nSince before the triple word score the first and third letters were worth one point apiece, they each account for a total of 1+1=<<1+1=2>>2 points.\nThus, the middle letter was valued at 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 points.

If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?\n\nSince Scrabble tripled the word score to thirty points, then it must have been worth 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\nSince the first and last letters were worth 1 point each, that leaves 10-1-1=<<10-1-1=8>>8 points for the middle letter.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby rotates 400 baseballs because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend rotates 404 apples because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nHis friend wins because 404 > 400.\nThe winner rotates 404 objects.

If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12.

We know that 30% of the 2000 community members were adult men, so 30/100 * 2000 = <<30/100*2000=600>>600 adult men were involved.\n\nSince there were twice as many adult women as adult men, we know that there were 2 * 600 = <<2*600=1200>>1200 adult women involved.\n\nTo calculate the number of children involved, we need to subtract the number of adult men and adult women from the total number of community members: 2000 - 600 - 1200 = <<2000-600-1200=200>>200 children.\n\nTherefore, the total number of children involved in the cleaning event is 200.

What percentage towards his goal is he?\n\nTo determine the percentage towards his goal, we need to find the proportion of haircuts Calvin has already gotten compared to his total goal. Calvin has gotten a total of 8 haircuts and needs 2 more to reach his goal, so his total goal is 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 haircuts.\nThe proportion of haircuts Calvin has already gotten is 8/10.\nTo convert this proportion to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (8/10) * 100 = 80.\nCalvin is therefore 80% towards his goal.

In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?\n\nOf his 12 roaches, Calvin has half as many crickets, so he has 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 crickets.\nOf his 3 scorpions, he has twice as many caterpillars, so he has 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 caterpillars.\nThus, in total, Calvin has 12 roaches + 3 scorpions + 6 crickets + 6 caterpillars = <<12+3+6+6=27>>27 insects.

If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nLet's start by finding out how many women are at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 guests is (40/100)*200 = <<(40/100)*200=80>>80 women.\nOut of the 80 women, 80% are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 women is (80/100)*80 = <<(80/100)*80=64>>64 women.\nNow let's find out how many men are at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200 and that 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 men.\nOut of the 120 men, 60% are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 men is (60/100)*120 = <<(60/100)*120=72>>72 men.\nThe total number of people wearing rabbit ears is 64 women + 72 men = <<64+72=136>>136 people. Answer: \\boxed{136}.\n\n\nQuestion: Calvin is a bug collector.

How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?\n\nCalvin has 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 crickets.\nHe has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 caterpillars.\nThus, Calvin has 12+3+6+6 = <<12+3+6+6=27>>27 insects in his collection. Answer: \\boxed{27}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bailey is making a rectangle out of a 100cm length of rope he has. If the longer sides of the rectangle were 28cm long, what is the length of each of the shorter sides?\n", "text": "Let the length of each of the shorter sides be x. Since the longer sides are 28cm long, we can set up the equation:\n\n2(x + 28) = 100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x + 56 = 100\n\nSubtracting 56 from both sides, we have:\n\n2x = 44\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\n\nx = 22\n\nTherefore, each of the shorter sides is 22cm long. Answer: \\boxed{22}."}
