Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake. If the two snakes have a combined length of 70 inches, how long is Jake's snake?\n\nLet x be the length of Jenny's snake.\nJake's snake is x + 12 inches long.\nThe total length of the two snakes is  x + (x + 12) = 70 inches\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 12 = 70\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 58\ndividing both sides by 2, we get x = 29 inches\nJake's snake is therefore 12 inches longer than Jenny's, or 29 + 12 = <<29+12=41>>41 inches.

Answer: \\boxed{71}.\n\n\nQuestion: John was 66 inches tall.  He had a growth spurt and grew 2 inches per month for 3 months.  How tall is he in feet?\n\nHe grew 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 inches\nSo he is 66+6=<<66+6=72>>72 inches\nThat means he is 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 feet tall. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: The total for the sum and product of Elvie's age and Arielle's age are 131. If Elvie's age is 10, how old is Arielle?\n", "text": "Let Arielle's age be represented by A. The sum of Elvie's age and Arielle's age is Elvie's age + A. The product of their ages is Elvie's age * A. We are given that the sum and product of their ages are 131, so we can set up the equation:\n\nElvie's age + A + Elvie's age * A = 131\n\nPlugging in Elvie's age as 10, we get:\n\n10 + A + 10A = 131\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n11A + 10 = 131\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides:\n\n11A = 121\n\nDividing both sides by 11, we find:\n\nA = 11\n\nTherefore, Arielle's age is 11. Answer: \\boxed{11}."}
