After a break, he resumes the task for another 2 hours achieving a third of the speed he was doing before. Leo, on the other hand, only works a third as many hours as Mike did before his break, but was twice as fast as Mike before he took his break. How many pamphlets do both manage to print at the end?\n\nMike's total for the first 9 hours is 600 pamphlets/hour * 9 hours = <<600*9=5400>>5400 pamphlets\nFor the next 2 hours, Mike's speed dropped to 600 pamphlets/hour / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 pamphlets/hour.\nDuring those 2 hours, he manages to print 200 pamphlets/hour * 2 hours = <<200*2=400>>400 pamphlets.\nLeo works a third the hours of Mike = 9 hours / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 hours.\nLeo's speed was double that of Mike before the break, so 600 pamphlets/hour * 2 = <<600*2=1200>>1200 pamphlets/hour.\nThus, Leo printed a total of 3 hours * 1200 pamphlets/hour = <<3*1200=3600>>3600 pamphlets.\nTogether, they printed 5400 pamphlets + 400 pamphlets + 3600 pamphlets = <<5400+400+3600=9400>>9400 pamphlets.
