Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jake is from a conservative household so during lunch at school one day, he gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance to a hungry friend. If candies cost 20 cents apiece and Jake's feeding allowance is $4, how many candies can his friend purchase with the money Jake gave to him?\n\nJake gave to his friend 1/4*$4 = $<<1/4*4=1>>1.\nTherefore Jake's friend can purchase $1/$0.20 = <<1/0.20=5>>5 candies. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jake is from a conservative household so during lunch at school one day, he gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance to a hungry friend. If candies cost 20 cents apiece and Jake's feeding allowance is $4, how many candies can his friend purchase with the money Jake gave to him?\n\nJake gave one-quarter of his feeding allowance, which is $4 * (1/4) = $<<4*(1/4)=1>>1.\nJake's friend can purchase $1 / $0.20/candy = <<1/0.2=5>>5 candies. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Alexander is going food shopping. If he buys 5 apples for $1 each and 2 oranges for $2 each, how much does he spend?\n\nThe cost of apples is $1 x 5 = $<<1*5=5>>5.\nThe cost of oranges is $2 x 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nSo, Alexander spends $5 + $4 = $<<5+4=9>>9. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Benjamin went to McDonald's to buy something for dinner. He bought a salad, a burger, and two packs of fries. He paid in total $15. How much did the burger cost, if one pack of fries was for $2 and the salad was three times that price?\n", "text": "The salad is three times the price of one pack of fries, so it costs $2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nLet's assume the cost of the burger is $x.\nTherefore, the total cost is $x + $6 + $2 + $2 = $15.\nTo find the cost of the burger, we can subtract the known costs from the total: $15 - $6 - $2 - $2 = $<<15-6-2-2=5>>5.\nSo, the burger costs $5. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}

He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe remainder is 12-4 = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges.\nOne-fourth of 8 is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges.

If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 oranges is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe first boy remains with 12 oranges - 4 oranges = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges after giving out some to his brother.\nOne-fourth of 8 oranges is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges.

Bob then doubled his rate for the second hour, and doubled his second hour rate for the third hour.  How many questions did Bob create in the three hours?\n\nBob created 13 question in hour 1, doubled to 2*13=<<13*2=26>>26 questions in hour 2.\nWith an additional doubling in pace, Bob created 26*2=<<26*2=52>>52 questions in the third hour.\nBob created 13+26+52=<<13+26+52=91>>91 questions during the test creation process. Answer: \\boxed{91}.\n\n\nQuestion: The total mask production was doubled every month by a company after the outbreak of Coronavirus due to increased demand. If the company produced 3000 masks in March, calculate the total mask production of July.\n", "text": "Let x be the number of masks produced in July. We know that the production is doubled every month, so the number of masks produced in April will be 2*3000 = 6000 masks. In May, it will be 2*6000 = 12000 masks. In June, it will be 2*12000 = 24000 masks. Therefore, the number of masks produced in July is 2*24000 = 48000 masks. Answer: \\boxed{48000}."}
