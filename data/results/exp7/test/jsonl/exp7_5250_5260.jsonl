The number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times as many as the people wearing checkered shirts. How many people are wearing vertical stripes?\n", "text": "Let's first find the number of people wearing horizontal stripes. Since the number of people wearing horizontal stripes is 4 times the number of people wearing checkered shirts, there are 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 people wearing horizontal stripes.\nNow, let's find the number of people wearing vertical stripes. Since there are 40 people in total and we know the number of people wearing checkered shirts and horizontal stripes, we can subtract those numbers from the total to find the number of people wearing vertical stripes. So, 40 - 7 - 28 = <<40-7-28=5>>5 people are wearing vertical stripes. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}

How many miles does Jim run in total during the 90 days?\n", "text": "In the first 30 days, Jim runs 5 miles/run * 30 days = <<5*30=150>>150 miles.\nIn the next 30 days, Jim runs 10 miles/run * 30 days = <<10*30=300>>300 miles.\nIn the final 30 days, Jim runs 20 miles/run * 30 days = <<20*30=600>>600 miles.\nIn total, Jim runs 150 miles + 300 miles + 600 miles = <<150+300+600=1050>>1050 miles.
