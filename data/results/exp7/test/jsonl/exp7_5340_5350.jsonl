How tall is Joe?\n\nLet x be Sara's height.\nJoe is 2x+6 inches tall.\nCombining the height of both, Sara and Joe is x+(2x+6)=120 inches.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x+6=120 inches\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3x=114 inches.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x=<<38=38>>38 inches.\nJoe's height is 2*38+6=82 inches. Answer: \\boxed{82}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason is climbing a telephone pole next to a tree his friend Matt is climbing. Matt can climb 6 feet/minute and Jason can climb 12 feet per minute. After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?\n\nAfter 7 minutes, Matt will have climbed 7 minutes * 6 feet/minute = <<7*6=42>>42 feet.\nAnd after 7 minutes, Jason will have climbed 7 minutes * 12 feet/minute = <<7*12=84>>84 feet.\nSo after 7 minutes, Jason will be 84 - 42 = <<84-42=42>>42 feet higher than Matt.

Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?\n\nGeorgia coughs 5 times a minute and they have been coughing for 20 minutes so she has coughed 5*20 = <<5*20=100>>100 times\nRobert coughs twice as many times as Georgia or 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 coughs a minute\nRobert coughs 10 times a minute and they have been coughing for 20 minutes so he has coughed 10*20 = <<10*20=200>>200 times\nTogether, they have coughed 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300 times. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: Brenda catches smallpox. She has 60 blisters on each arm and 80 blisters on the rest of her body. How many blisters does she have in total?\n\nBrenda has 60 blisters on each arm, so she has a total of 60 * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 blisters on both arms.\nThus, Brenda has a total of 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 blisters on her whole body. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?\n\nLet L be the length of the sandbox.\nThe width of the sandbox is L/2 ft.\nThe perimeter is L + L + L/2 + L/2 = 30 ft.\nCombining like terms, we get 3L/2 + 3L/2 = 30.\nCombining like terms, we get 6L/2 = 30.\nDividing both sides by 1/2, we get 6L = 60.\nDividing both sides by 6, we get L = 10 ft.\nThe width of the sandbox is 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 ft. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Brenda catches smallpox. She has 60 blisters on each arm and 80 blisters on the rest of her body. How many blisters does she have in total?\n\nBrenda has a total of 60 x 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 blisters on her arms.\nShe has a total of 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 blisters. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 12 inches to a foot. Blossom measures her room and finds that it is exactly 10 feet long in each direction. In square inches, what is the area of her room?\n", "text": "Each side of the room is 10 feet, which is equal to 10 x 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 inches.\nTherefore, the area of the room is 120 x 120 = <<120*120=14400>>14400 square inches. Answer: \\boxed{14400}."}

If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of days in 4 years without any leap years. There are 365 days in a year, so 365 * 4 = <<365*4=1460>>1460 days in 4 years.\nSince James writes a comic every other day, we need to divide the total number of days by 2 to find the number of comics he has written: 1460 / 2 = <<1460/2=730>>730 comics. Answer: \\boxed{730}.\n\n\nQuestion: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of days in 4 years:\nTotal days = 365 days/year * 4 years = <<365*4=1460>>1460 days\n\nSince James writes a comic every other day, we divide the total number of days by 2 to find the number of comics:\nNumber of comics = 1460 days / 2 = <<1460/2=730>>730 comics. Answer: \\boxed{730}.\n\n\nQuestion: James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\n\nIn a year without a leap year, there are 365 days. \n\nTo find the number of comics James has written in a year, we divide the number of days in a year by the frequency (every other day). \n\n365 days / 2 = 182.5 comics per year.\n\nTherefore, in 4 years, he has written 4 years * 182.5 comics/year = <<4*182.5=730>>730 comics. Answer: \\boxed{730}.\n\n\nQuestion: Brian loves watching animal videos online.  He watches a 4-minute video of cats.  He then watches a video twice as long as the cat video involving dogs.  He finishes up his video watching for the day by watching a video on gorillas that's twice as long as the previous two videos combined.  How many minutes does Brian spend watching animal videos?\n\nBrian watches a 4-minute cat video and then watches a video twice as long at 4*2= <<4*2=8>>8 minutes.\nThe previous two videos total 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 minutes.\nThus, the video Brian watches on gorillas is 12*2= <<12*2=24>>24 minutes.\nBrian spends a total of 4+8+24= <<4+8+24=36>>36 minutes watching animal videos. Answer: \\boxed{36}.\n\n\nQuestion: Toby is in a juggling contest with a friend. The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes. Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby rotates 400 baseballs because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend rotates 404 apples because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nHis friend wins because 404 > 400.\nThe winner rotates 404 objects. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Samuel is driving to San Francisco\u2019s Comic-Con in his car and he needs to travel 600 miles to the hotel where he made a reservation. At first, he drives at 50 miles/hour for 3 hours straight, then he speeds up to 80 miles/hour for 4 hours. How far is he from the hotel?\n", "text": "Samuel drives 50 miles/hour for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 50 miles/hour * 3 hours = <<50*3=150>>150 miles.\nHe then drives at 80 miles/hour for 4 hours, covering a distance of 80 miles/hour * 4 hours = <<80*4=320>>320 miles.\nIn total, Samuel has driven 150 miles + 320 miles = <<150+320=470>>470 miles.\nTherefore, he is 600 miles - 470 miles = <<600-470=130>>130 miles away from the hotel.
