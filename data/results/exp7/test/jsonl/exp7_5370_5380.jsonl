He again went up 7 floors and found that he is 9 floors away from the top of the building. How many floors does the building have?\n\nEarl started on the first floor and went up 5 floors, so he is now on the 1 + 5 = <<1+5=6>>6th floor.\nHe then went down 2 floors, so he is now on the 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4th floor.\nHe then went up 7 floors, so he is now on the 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11th floor.\nSince he is 9 floors away from the top of the building, then the building has a total of 11 + 9 = <<11+9=20>>20 floors. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Keaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times while working at the construction site. Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?\n\nIf Keaton climbed a ladder twenty times, climbing 30 feet each time, his total is 20*30 = <<20*30=600>>600 feet.\nReece, climbing a 4 feet shorter ladder fifteen times, climbs a total of 15*(30-4) = <<15*(30-4)=390>>390 feet.\nConverting Keaton's Climb to inches gives 600*12 = <<600*12=7200>>7200 inches\nSimilarly, Reece's climb in inches is 390*12 = <<390*12=4680>>4680 inches.\nTogether, Reece and Keaton climbed 4680+7200 = <<4680+7200=11880>>11880 inches. Answer: \\boxed{11880}.\n\n\nQuestion: Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?\n\nLet L be the length of the sandbox.\nThe width of the sandbox is L/2 ft.\nThe perimeter is L + L + L/2 + L/2 = 30 ft.\nCombining like terms, we get 3L/2 + 3L/2 = 30.\nCombining like terms, we get 6L/2 = 30.\nDividing both sides by 1/2, we get 6L = 60.\nDividing both sides by 6, we get L = 10 ft.\nThe width of the sandbox is 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 ft. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: James builds a 20 story building.  The first 10 stories are each 12 feet tall each.  The remaining floors are each 3 feet taller.  How tall is the building?\n", "text": "The total height of the first 10 stories is 10 * 12 = <<10*12=120>>120 feet.\nThe remaining 10 stories are each 3 feet taller, so they are 12 + 3 = <<12+3=15>>15 feet tall each.\nThe total height of the remaining stories is 10 * 15 = <<10*15=150>>150 feet.\nTherefore, the total height of the building is 120 + 150 = <<120+150=270>>270 feet. Answer: \\boxed{270}."}
