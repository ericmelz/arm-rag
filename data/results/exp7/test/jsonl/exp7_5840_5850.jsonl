Each rung of the ladder is 18 inches long and they are 6 inches apart.  If he needs to climb 50 feet how many feet of wood will he need for the rungs?\n\nFirst convert the length of each rung from inches to feet: 18 inches/rung / 12 inches/foot = <<18/12=1.5>>1.5 feet/rung\nThen divide the total distance James needs to climb by the distance between each step to find how many steps he needs: 50 feet / 6 inches/step * 12 inches/foot = <<50/6*12=100>>100 rungs\nThen multiply the number of rungs by the length of each rung to find the total length of the rungs: 1.5 feet/rung * 100 rungs = <<1.5*100=150>>150 feet. Answer: \\boxed{150}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jack goes up three flights of stairs, then down six flights of stairs. If each flight of stairs has 12 steps that each each 8 inches high, how many feet further down is Jack than when he started?\n\nFirst find the total distance Jack traveled up the stairs by multiplying the number of steps per flight by the number of flights: 12 steps/flight * 3 flights = <<12*3=36>>36 steps\nThen multiply the number of steps by the height of each step to find the total distance up the stairs in inches: 36 steps * 8 inches/step = <<36*8=288>>288 inches\nThen find the total distance Jack traveled down the stairs by multiplying the number of steps per flight by the number of flights: 12 steps/flight * 6 flights = <<12*6=72>>72 steps\nThen multiply the number of steps by the height of each step to find the total distance down the stairs in inches: 72 steps * 8 inches/step = <<72*8=576>>576 inches\nThen subtract the distance up from the distance down to find the net distance Jack traveled: 576 inches - 288 inches = <<576-288=288>>288 inches\nThen divide the distance in inches by the number of inches per foot to find the distance in feet: 288 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<288/12=24>>24 feet.

Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?\n\nIf Keaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times, he climbed a total of 30*20=<<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nIn inches, this is equal to 12*600 = <<12*600=7200>>7200 inches.\nReece climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's, which is 30-4 = 26 feet.\nIf he climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 26*15 =<<26*15=390>>390 feet.\nIn inches, this is equal to 12*390 = <<12*390=4680>>4680 inches.\nTogether, the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed is 7200+4680 = <<7200+4680=11880>>11880 inches. Answer: \\boxed{11880}.\n\n\nQuestion: Earl started delivering newspapers on the first floor of a condominium building. He then went up 5 floors then went down 2 floors. He again went up 7 floors and found that he is 9 floors away from the top of the building. How many floors does the building have?\n\nLet x be the number of floors in the building.\nAfter going up 5 floors, Earl is on the first floor + 5 = <<5+1=6>>6th floor.\nAfter going down 2 floors, Earl is on the 6th floor - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4th floor.\nAfter going up 7 floors, Earl is on the 4th floor + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11th floor.\nSince Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building, then x - 11 = 9.\nTherefore, the building has x = 9 + 11 = <<9+11=20>>20 floors. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Keaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times while working at the construction site. Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?\n\nIf Keaton climbed a ladder twenty times, climbing 30 feet each time, his total is 20*30 = <<20*30=600>>600 feet.\nReece, climbing a 4 feet shorter ladder fifteen times, climbs a total of 15*(30-4) = <<15*(30-4)=390>>390 feet.\nConverting Keaton's Climb to inches gives 600*12 = <<600*12=7200>>7200 inches\nSimilarly, Reece's climb in inches is 390*12 = <<390*12=4680>>4680 inches.\nTogether, Reece and Keaton climbed 4680+7200 = <<4680+7200=11880>>11880 inches.
