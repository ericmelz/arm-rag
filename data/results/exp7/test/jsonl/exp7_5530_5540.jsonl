How many questions does Grayson leave unanswered when he submits his test?\n\nTwo hours is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes\nHe takes 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 questions answered\nHe has to answer 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 questions. Answer: \\boxed{40}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark has two pets, a hare that runs 10 feet/second and a turtle that crawls 1 foot/second. If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare would need to run 20 feet in the same amount of time it takes the turtle to crawl 20 feet. \nSince the hare runs 10 feet/second, it would take 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds for the hare to run the 20 feet.\nSince the turtle crawls 1 foot/second, it would take 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds for the turtle to crawl the 20 feet.\nThus, the turtle needs a head start of 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds to finish in a tie. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason is tired of the neighborhood animals raiding his trash. He pepper-sprays some raccoons and 6 times as many squirrels. If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason is tired of the neighborhood animals raiding his trash. He pepper-sprays some raccoons and 6 times as many squirrels.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Cody has an insurance plan that will give him a discount if he logs a total of 100,000 steps. For the first week, he logs 1,000 steps a day.  He increases his daily number of steps by 1,000 every week.  After 4 weeks how far away from his step goal will he be?\n", "text": "In the first week, Cody logs 1,000 steps per day * 7 days = 7,000 steps.\nIn the second week, he logs 2,000 steps per day * 7 days = 14,000 steps.\nIn the third week, he logs 3,000 steps per day * 7 days = 21,000 steps.\nIn the fourth week, he logs 4,000 steps per day * 7 days = 28,000 steps.\nIn total, Cody logs 7,000 + 14,000 + 21,000 + 28,000 = 70,000 steps.\nHe will be 100,000 - 70,000 = 30,000 steps away from his step goal.

How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 oranges is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe first boy remains with 12 oranges - 4 oranges = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges after giving out some to his brother.\nOne-fourth of 8 oranges is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20. If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nIf Coraline's number is 80, then Jayden's number is 80-40 = <<80-40=40>>40.\nMickey's number is 20+40 = <<20+40=60>>60\nThe total of the numbers they have is 80+40+60 = <<80+40+60=180>>180.

Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: The ratio of cows to bulls in a barn is 10:27. If there are 555 cattle on the farm, how many bulls are on the farm?\n", "text": "The total ratio of cows to bulls is 10+27 = 37.\nIf there are 555 cattle on the farm, and the ratio of cows to bulls is 10:27, then the total parts in the ratio is 10+27 = 37.\nSince 37 parts are equivalent to 555 cattle, one part is equal to 555/37 = 15 cattle.\nTherefore, the number of bulls on the farm is 27 parts * 15 cattle per part = 405 bulls. Answer: \\boxed{405}."}
