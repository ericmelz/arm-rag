In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?\n\nOf his 12 roaches, Calvin has half as many crickets, so he has 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 crickets.\nOf his 3 scorpions, he has twice as many caterpillars, so he has 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 caterpillars.\nThus, in total, Calvin has 12 roaches + 3 scorpions + 6 crickets + 6 caterpillars = <<12+3+6+6=27>>27 insects. Answer: \\boxed{27}.\n\n\nQuestion: Calvin is a bug collector.

How many total calories did he eat?\n", "text": "If John eats 10 potato chips that have a total of 60 calories, then each potato chip has 60/10 = <<60/10=6>>6 calories.\n6 cheezits each have 1/3 more calories than a chip, so they each have 6 + (1/3)*6 = 6 + 2 = <<6+(1/3)*6=8>>8 calories.\nIf he eats 6 cheezits, then the total number of calories he eats from them is 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 calories.\nAltogether, John eats 60 + 48 = <<60+48=108>>108 total calories. Answer: \\boxed{108}."}
