If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: Winston had 10 gallons of gas in his car\u2019s gas tank. He drives to the store and uses 6 gallons of gas. Then he drives to the doctor\u2019s office and uses 2 gallons of gas. If the tank can hold up to 12 gallons of gas, how many gallons of gas will Winston need to refill the entire tank?\n", "text": "Winston initially had 10 gallons of gas in his tank.
