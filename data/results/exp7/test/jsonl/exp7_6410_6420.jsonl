At T-Mobile, the family plan costs $50 per month for the first two lines and $16 for each additional line. At M-Mobile, the family plan costs $45 for the first two lines and $14 for each additional line. Moore's family needs to purchase 5 cell phone lines. How much cheaper is the M-Mobile than T-Mobile?\n", "text": "To calculate the cost of the T-Mobile plan, we need to consider the cost for the first two lines and the cost for each additional line. The cost for the first two lines is $50. For the additional lines (3 lines since there are five total lines), the cost is $16 per line. So the total cost for T-Mobile is $50 + ($16 * 3) = $50 + $48 = $98.\n\nFor the M-Mobile plan, the cost for the first two lines is $45. For the additional lines (3 lines), the cost is $14 per line. So the total cost for M-Mobile is $45 + ($14 * 3) = $45 + $42 = $87.\n\nTo find out how much cheaper M-Mobile is compared to T-Mobile, we subtract the M-Mobile cost from the T-Mobile cost. $98 - $87 = $11.\n\nTherefore, M-Mobile is $11 cheaper than T-Mobile.
