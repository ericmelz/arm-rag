And Milo's best friend, Cory, can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard.  If Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, how many miles can Milo run in two hours?\n\nIf Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, then Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at a speed of 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd if Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run, then Milo can run at a speed of 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 miles per hour.\nTherefore, in two hours, Milo can run at a distance of 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles.

What is the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped?\n\nThe total number of striped nails is 20 - 6 - 8 = <<20-6-8=6>>6.\nThe percentage of striped nails is 6/20 * 100% = 30%.\nThe difference between the percentage of blue nails and striped nails is 8/20 * 100% - 30% = 40% - 30% = <<8/20*100%-30%=10>>10%.

And Milo's best friend, Cory, can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard.  If Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, how many miles can Milo run in two hours?\n\nIf Cory always drives his wheelchair at 12 miles per hour, and Cory can drive his wheelchair at twice the speed that Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard, this means that Milo rolls downhill on his skateboard at 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nSince Milo can roll downhill on his skateboard at twice the speed that he can run, this means Milo can run 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 miles per hour.\nIf Milo can run 3 miles per hour, this means Milo can run 3*2= <<3*2=6>>6 miles in two hours. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Apple can run at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Mac can run at a rate of 4 miles per hour. In minutes, how much faster will Mac run a 24 mile race?\n\nTo find out how much faster Mac will run a 24 mile race, we need to calculate the difference in their speeds. \n\nApple's speed is 3 miles per hour, which means she will take (24 / 3) = 8 hours to complete the race.\nMac's speed is 4 miles per hour, which means he will take (24 / 4) = 6 hours to complete the race.\n\nThe difference in their times is 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 hours.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, Mac will run the race 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes faster. Answer: \\boxed{120}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jill is painting her 20 toenails and fingernails. She paints 6 of her nails purple, 8 of them blue, and the rest striped. What is the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped?\n\nThere are a total of 20 nails. If we subtract the number of purple nails and blue nails, we find that 20-6-8=<<20-6-8=6>>6 nails are striped.\nThe percentage of nails that are blue is 8/20=0.4*100%=<<8/20=40>>40%.\nThe percentage of nails that are striped is 6/20=0.3*100%=<<6/20=30>>30%.\nThe difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and striped is 40-30=<<40-30=10>>10%.

And Tony can skip at twice the speed that Bruce can.  At what speed, in miles per hour, can Colin skip if Bruce skips at 1 mile per hour?\n", "text": "If Bruce skips at 1 mile per hour, then Tony can skip at 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 miles per hour.\nIf Tony can skip at 2 miles per hour, then Brandon can skip at 1/3*2=2/3=<<1/3*2=2/3>>2/3 miles per hour.\nIf Brandon can skip at 2/3 miles per hour, then Colin can skip at 6*2/3=4 miles per hour.\nTherefore, Colin can skip at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

If candies cost 20 cents apiece and Jake's feeding allowance is $4, how many candies can his friend purchase with the money Jake gave to him?\n\nJake's feeding allowance is $4 so 1/4 of this amount is $4*(1/4) = $<<4*(1/4)=1>>1\nIf each candy costs $0.20, Jake's friend can purchase $1/$0.20 = <<1/0.20=5>>5 candies.

If the Magnet cost $3, how much, in dollars, did a single stuffed animal cost?\n\nThe magnet cost three times more than the sticker, so more exactly it was 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dollars more.\nThus the two stuffed animals cost 3+9=<<3+9=12>>12 dollars at the garage sale.\nTherefore, a single stuffed animal would cost 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 dollars each. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Janet, a third grade teacher, is picking up the sack lunch order from a local deli for the field trip she is taking her class on. There are 35 children in her class, 5 volunteer chaperones, and herself. She she also ordered three additional sack lunches, just in case there was a problem. Each sack lunch costs $7. How much do all the lunches cost in total?\n", "text": "There are a total of 35 children, 5 chaperones, and 1 teacher, for a total of 35+5+1=<<35+5+1=41>>41 people.\nJanet also ordered 3 additional lunches, bringing the total number of lunches to 41+3=<<41+3=44>>44.\nSince each lunch costs $7, the total cost for all the lunches is 44*$7 = $<<44*7=308>>308.
