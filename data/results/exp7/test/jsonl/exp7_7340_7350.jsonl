They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?\n\nBased on the given information, we can outline the ages of the four classmates as follows:\n\nAivo\nTherese (Aivo + 5)\nJolyn (Therese + 2)\nLeon (Aivo + 2)\n\nThus, Jolyn is (Aivo + 5 + 2) = (Aivo + 7) months older than Aivo. Similarly, Leon is (Aivo + 2) months older than Aivo.\n\nTo find the age difference between Jolyn and Leon, we subtract the expressions representing their ages:\n\nJolyn - Leon = (Aivo + 7) - (Aivo + 2)\n= Aivo + 7 - Aivo - 2\n= 7 - 2\n= 5.\n\nSo, Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon.
