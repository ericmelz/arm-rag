If Hugo climbed his mountain 3 times, how many times would Boris need to climb his mountain to have climbed the same number of feet as Hugo?\n\nBoris' mountain is 10,000-2,500=<<10000-2500=7500>>7500 feet above sea level.\nClimbing one of Hugo's mountains means traveling 10,000*3=<<10000*3=30000>>30,000 feet.\nTherefore, Boris would need to climb his mountain 30,000/7,500=<<30000/7500=4>>4 times to equal the number of feet Hugo has climbed.

From Tuesday to Thursday he ran 50% faster than on Monday. Then on Friday, he ran 60% faster than he ran on Thursday. How fast did Harry run on Friday?\n\nOn Tuesday to Thursday, Harry ran 10 x 50/100 = <<10*50/100=5>>5 meters faster.\nSo his speed on Tuesday to Thursday was 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 meters per hour.\nThen on Friday, he ran 15 x 60/100 = <<15*60/100=9>>9 meters faster than on Thursday.\nSo his speed on Friday was 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 meters per hour.

Based on the impressions, he could tell the animal was traveling east at 15 miles per hour, and that the animal left the prints 1 hour ago.  If the coyote continues to travel east at 15 miles per hour, and Darrell hops on his motorbike and travels east at 30 miles per hour, how long, in hours, will it take for Darrel to catch up to the coyote?\n\nThe coyote has been traveling east for 15 miles per hour for 1 hour, so it has traveled 15*1 = <<15*1=15>>15 miles.\nDarrell is traveling east at 30 miles per hour, so he will catch up to the coyote at a rate of 30-15 = <<30-15=15>>15 miles per hour.\nTo travel 15 miles at a rate of 15 miles per hour, it will take Darrell 15/15 = <<15/15=1>>1 hour.

The other trail is 12 miles, but it's mostly uphill, so James will only be able to cover 3 miles per hour and will have to take an hour break halfway through. How many hours faster is the fastest hike?\n", "text": "For the first trail, James can hike 20 miles at a speed of 5 miles per hour, so it will take him 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 hours.\nFor the second trail, James can hike 12 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour, so it will take him 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 hours. However, he will also need to take a one hour break, so the total time for the second trail is 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 hours.\nTherefore, the fastest hike is the first trail, which is 5 - 4 = <<5-4=1>>1 hour faster.

For every 5 feet of pipe, Edward must use one tightening bolt, and for every bolt, he uses two washers.  He buys a bag of 20 washers for the job.  After he completes the bathroom job, how many washers will be remaining in the bag?\n\nEdward needs to use 40/5 = <<40/5=8>>8 tightening bolts for the job.\nTherefore, he must also use 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 washers.\nThis means there will be 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 washers remaining in the bag.

After he completes the bathroom job, how many washers will be remaining in the bag?\n\nEdward will need to use 40/5=<<40/5=8>>8 bolts to do the job.\nThus he will need to use 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 washers.\nIf he buys a bag of 20 washers, then he will have 20-16=<<20-16=4>>4 washers left. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: In 2004, there were 60 kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. How many kids came to the cookout in 2006?\n\nHalf the number of kids from 2004 is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 kids.\nTwo-thirds as many as 2005's 30 kids is 30 * 2 / 3 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 kids.

After he completes the bathroom job, how many washers will be remaining in the bag?\n\nFor his plumbing job, Edward must use 40/5 = <<40/5=8>>8 bolts.\nSince Edward uses 2 washers per bolt, the 8 bolts will require a total of 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16 washers.\nTherefore there will be 20-16 = <<20-16=4>>4 washers remaining in the package. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: In 2004, there were some kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. If there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006, how many kids came to the cookout in 2004?\n", "text": "Let the number of kids at the cookout in 2004 be x.\nHalf the number of kids from 2004 is x/2.\nTwo-thirds as many as 2005's x/2 kids is (x/2)*2/3 = x/3.\nSince there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006, x/3 = 20.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 60.\nTherefore, there were 60 kids at the cookout in 2004. Answer: \\boxed{60}."}
