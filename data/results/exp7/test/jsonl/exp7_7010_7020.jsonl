A large pizza is 14. It costs $2 per topping. He orders 2 large pizzas, each with 3 toppings. He then adds a 25% tip. What is the total cost?\n\nThe cost of the toppings is 3*2=$<<3*2=6>>6 per pizza.\nSo the cost of the toppings for 2 pizzas is 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12.\nSo the total cost of the pizzas before tip is 12+14*2=$<<12+14*2=40>>40.\nThe tip amount comes to 40*.25=$<<40*.25=10>>10.\nSo the total amount with the tip is 40+10=$<<40+10=50>>50.

He also needs 10 pounds of salt and salt cost $.2 a pound.  He also spends $1000 promoting everything.  He then sells tickets for $20 each and sells 500 tickets.  How much money did he make?\n\nHe needs 500/50=<<500/50=10>>10 bags of flour\nThat cost 10*20=$<<10*20=200>>200\nThat means he pays 10*.2=$<<10*.2=2>>2 in salt\nSo his materials cost 1000+200+2=$<<1000+200+2=1202>>1202\nHe makes 500*20=$<<500*20=10000>>10,000 from selling tickets\nSo he makes a profit of 10000-1202=$<<10000-1202=8798>>8798.

She finds a stalk of celery for $5, cereal for 50% off $12, bread for $8, and milk for 10% off $10. She finds potatoes for $1 each and buys 6. How many dollars does she have left to spend on coffee?\n\nThe cereal is $12 * 50% = $<<12*50*.01=6>>6 off.\nSo the cereal costs $12 - $6 = $<<12-6=6>>6.\nThe milk is $10 * 10% = $<<10*10*.01=1>>1 off.\nSo the milk costs $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.\nAnd the potatoes cost $1 * 6 = $<<1*6=6>>6.\nThe celery, cereal, bread, milk, and potatoes cost a total of $5 + $6 + $8 + $9 + $6 = $<<5+6+8+9+6=34>>34.\nLily has $60 - $34 = $<<60-34=26>>26 left to spend on coffee.

If the Magnet cost $3, how much, in dollars, did a single stuffed animal cost?\n\nThe magnet cost three times more than the sticker, which cost $3 so the sticker is $3/3 = $<<3/3=1>>1\nThe magnet also cost one fourth the price of the two stuffed animals combined so the 2 stuffed animals cost $3*4 = $<<3*4=12>>12\nEach stuffed animals costs $12/2 = $<<12/2=6>>6. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a garage sale, Tish bought 4 items: a red horseshoe magnet, two stuffed animals, and a large sticker which read, \"Why can't teachers solve their own math problems?\"  The magnet cost three times more than the sticker, but only one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined.  If the Magnet cost $3, how much, in dollars, did a single stuffed animal cost?\n\nThe magnet cost three times more than the sticker, so more exactly it was 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dollars more.\nThus the two stuffed animals cost 3+9=<<3+9=12>>12 dollars at the garage sale.\nTherefore, a single stuffed animal would cost 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 dollars each.

What is the width of the sandbox?\n\nLet L be the length of the sandbox.\nThe width of the sandbox is L/2 ft.\nThe perimeter is L + L + L/2 + L/2 = 30 ft.\nCombining like terms, we get 3L/2 + 3L/2 = 30.\nCombining like terms, we get 6L/2 = 30.\nDividing both sides by 1/2, we get 6L = 60.\nDividing both sides by 6, we get L = 10 ft.\nThe width of the sandbox is 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 ft.

Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nLet's work through the information provided step by step.\nWe know that there are 25 different layers in total.\nOut of these 25 layers, 5 are limestone, which means that there are 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 layers remaining.\nHalf of the rest are sandstone, so there are 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 layers of sandstone.\nNow there are 20 - 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 layers left, which are not limestone or sandstone.\nFour of these remaining layers are quartz, so there are 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 layers left that are not limestone, sandstone, or quartz.\nOut of these 6 layers, half are shale, which means there are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 layers of shale.\nFinally, the remaining layers are all different kinds of rock. These are 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 layers.\nTherefore, there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata.
