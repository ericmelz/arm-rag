Julia wants to buy 4 of each, but she only has 75 dollars. How much money is she short?\n\nThe cost of the rock and roll CDs is 5 x 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 dollars.\nThe cost of the pop CDs is 10 x 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 dollars.\nThe cost of the dance CDs is 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 dollars.\nThe cost of the country CDs is 7 x 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 dollars.\nTherefore, the total cost of the CDs is 20 + 40 + 12 + 28 = <<20+40+12+28=100>>100 dollars.\nJulia is short by 100 - 75 = <<100-75=25>>25 dollars. Answer: \\boxed{25}.\n\n\nQuestion: Alan likes to support music creators, so instead of downloading songs from the internet, he visits a record store once in a while. He decided now to buy 2 CDs by \"The Dark\", 1 CD by the creator \"AVN\", and 5 CDs that are mixes of songs from the 90s. The price of the \"AVN\" CD is $12 and it is half the price of one CD by \"The Dark\". The 5 CDs of 90s music cost is 40% of all the cost of all other CDs Alan is going to buy. How much will Alan have to pay for all the products?\n", "text": "Let's say the cost of one CD by \"The Dark\" is $x. \n\nThe price of the \"AVN\" CD is $12, which is half the price of one CD by \"The Dark\". \nSo, $12 = 0.5x, which implies x = $24. \n\nThe total cost of the 2 CDs by \"The Dark\" is 2 * $24 = $48. \n\nThe 5 CDs of 90s music cost 40% of all the other CDs. \nSo, the cost of the 90s CDs is 0.4 * ($48 + $12) = $0.4 * $60 = $24. \n\nTherefore, Alan will have to pay $48 + $12 + $24 = $84 for all the products. Answer: \\boxed{84}."}
