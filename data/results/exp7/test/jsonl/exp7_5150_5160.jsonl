If the total number of cups brought by the students in the class is 90, how many cups did each girl bring?\n\nTwice the number of boys in the class is the number of girls, so there are 2*10 boys = <<2*10=20>>20 girls in the class.\nThere are therefore 20+10= <<20+10=30>>30 students in the class, which is the total number of students Ms. Leech is teaching.\nDuring the science activity class period, the students brought to the class in total 5 cups/boy * 10 boys = <<5*10=50>>50 cups.\nThe girls brought in total 90 cups - 50 cups = <<90-50=40>>40 cups.\nIn total in the class there are 20 girls * x cups/girl = <<20*x=40>>40 cups.\nThis shows that each girl brought to the class 40 cups / 20 girls = <<40/20=2>>2 cups/girl.

Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nLet's work through the information provided step by step.\nWe know that there are 25 different layers in total.\nOut of these 25 layers, 5 are limestone, which means that there are 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 layers remaining.\nHalf of the rest are sandstone, so there are 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 layers of sandstone.\nNow there are 20 - 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 layers left, which are not limestone or sandstone.\nFour of these remaining layers are quartz, so there are 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 layers left that are not limestone, sandstone, or quartz.\nOut of these 6 layers, half are shale, which means there are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 layers of shale.\nFinally, the remaining layers are all different kinds of rock. These are 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 layers.\nTherefore, there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata.
