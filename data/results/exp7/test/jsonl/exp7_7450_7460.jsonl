Haley could hold 8 marshmallows in her mouth. Michael could hold 3 times as many marshmallows as Haley. Brandon could hold half as many as Michael. How many total marshmallows did all three kids hold in their mouths?\n\nMichael could hold 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 marshmallows.\nBrandon could hold 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 marshmallows.\nTherefore, the total number of marshmallows all three kids hold in their mouths is 8 + 24 + 12 = <<8+24+12=44>>44 marshmallows.

If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet s be the number of squirrels Jason pepper-sprays and r be the number of raccoons. We know that s = 6r and s + r = 84.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 6r + r = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7r = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get r = 12. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: On our last vacation, I bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns. Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies. If Rick bought 30 guppies, how many animals did we buy on our last vacation?\n\nTim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies, which means Tim bought 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 clowns.\nI bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns, which means I bought 4 * 60 = <<4*60=240>>240 tetras.\nSo on our last vacation, we bought a total of 240 tetras + 60 clowns + 30 guppies = <<240+60+30=330>>330 animals.

If each wombat claws him 4 times and each rhea claws him once, how many times does he get clawed?\n\nIn the enclosure, Carson will get clawed 9 wombats * 4 claws/wombat = <<9*4=36>>36 times.\nAdditionally, Carson will get clawed 3 rheas * 1 claw/rhea = <<3*1=3>>3 times.\nTherefore, Carson gets clawed 36 + 3 = <<36+3=39>>39 times. Answer: \\boxed{39}.\n\n\nQuestion: Carson leans over the railing at the zoo to get the perfect selfie and falls into the combined wombat and rhea enclosure.  There are 9 wombats and 3 rheas. If each wombat claws him 4 times and each rhea claws him once, how many times does he get clawed?\n\nIf there are 9 wombats, and each claws him 4 times, then the wombats claw him a total of 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 times.\nIf the 3 rheas claw him once, then he gets clawed by the rheas a total of 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 times.\nThus, he gets clawed a total of 36 + 3 = <<36+3=39>>39 times.
