Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?\n\nKristy's basic salary for the month is $7.50/hour x 160 hours = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.\nHer earnings from commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nSo, her total earnings is $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=5200>>5200.\nHer budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills, and savings is $5200 x 95/100 = $<<5200*95/100=4940>>4940.\nThus, she allocated $5200 - $4940 = $<<5200-4940=260>>260 for insurance. Answer: \\boxed{260}.\n\n\nQuestion: Zoe wants to go on the field trip to Washington DC with her middle school this spring and the cost is $485. Her grandma gave her $250 toward her fees and she must earn the rest by selling candy bars. She makes $1.25 for every candy bar she sells. How many candy bars does Zoe need to sell to earn the money for the trip?\n\nTo find out how much money Zoe needs to earn, subtract the amount her grandma gave her from the total cost: $485 - $250 = $<<485-250=235>>235.\nNext, divide the total amount of money she needs to earn by the amount she earns per candy bar sale: $235 / $1.25/candy bar = <<235/1.25=188>>188 candy bars. Answer: \\boxed{188}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mrs. Garcia pays her insurance quarterly at $378.

Each cow on the farm drinks 80 liters of water daily. He also has a sheep ranch with 10 times the number of cows, with each sheep drinking 1/4 times as much water as a cow does. How many liters of water does Mr. Reyansh use to water all of his animals in a week?\n\nThe number of liters needed by each cow in a week is 80 liters/day * 7 days = <<80*7=560>>560 liters/week.\nThe total number of liters of water needed by all the cows on the dairy farm in a week is 560 liters/cow * 40 cows = <<560*40=22400>>22400 liters/week.\nMr. Reyansh also has 10 * 40 = <<10*40=400>>400 sheep on his ranch.\nThe amount of liters needed by each sheep in a day is 80 liters/cow * 1/4 = <<80*1/4=20>>20 liters/sheep/day.\nIn a week, each sheep needs 20 liters/sheep/day * 7 days/week = <<20*7=140>>140 liters/sheep/week.\nThe total number of liters of water needed by all of the sheep on the sheep ranch in a week is 140 liters/sheep/week * 400 sheep = <<140*400=56000>>56000 liters/week.\nThe total number of liters of water used in a week by Mr. Reyansh for both his cows and sheep is 56000 liters/week + 22400 liters/week = <<56000+22400=78400>>78400 liters/week.

Brownie, the largest cow, produces three times that amount. Then Daisy makes one pail more than Bess. How many pails of milk does Farmer Red get from them each week?\n\nBess produces 2 pails of milk x 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 pails in a week.\nBrownie produces 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 pails of milk every day.\nBrownie produces in a week 6 pails x 7 days = <<6*7=42>>42 pails.\nDaisy produces 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 pails every day.\nDaisy produces in a week 3 pails x 7 days = <<3*7=21>>21 pails.\nFarmer Red gets 14 pails + 42 pails + 21 pails = <<14+42+21=77>>77 pails of milk from them each week.

Brownie, the largest cow, produces three times that amount. Then Daisy makes one pail more than Bess. How many pails of milk does Farmer Red get from them each week?\n\nBess produces 2 pails of milk every day, so she produces 2 pails * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 pails of milk every week.\nBrownie produces 3 * 2 pails = <<3*2=6>>6 pails every day.\nSo Brownie produces 6 pails * 7 days = <<6*7=42>>42 pails every week.\nDaisy produces 2 pails + 1 pail = <<2+1=3>>3 pails every day.\nSo Daisy produces 3 pails * 7 days = <<3*7=21>>21 pails every week.\nAltogether, they produce 14 pails + 42 pails + 21 pails = <<14+42+21=77>>77 pails of milk every week.

He also has a sheep ranch with 10 times the number of cows, with each sheep drinking 1/4 times as much water as a cow does. How many liters of water does Mr. Reyansh use to water all of his animals in a week?\n\nThe cows on Mr. Reyansh's dairy farm drink a total of 40 cows * 80 liters/cow/day = <<40*80=3200>>3200 liters of water a day.\nIn a week, the cows drink 3200 liters/cow/day * 7 days/week = <<3200*7=22400>>22400 liters of water in total.\nMr. Reyansh has 10 times as many sheep as cows, so there are 10 sheep/cow * 40 cows = <<10*40=400>>400 sheep on the sheep ranch.\nEach sheep drinks 1/4 times as much water as a cow, so each sheep drinks 80 liters/cow * 1/4 = <<80*1/4=20>>20 liters/day.\nIn a week, the sheep drink 20 liters/sheep/day * 7 days/week = <<20*7=140>>140 liters each in total.\nIn total, the sheep drink 140 liters/sheep * 400 sheep = <<140*400=56000>>56000 liters of water in a week.\nSo, in total, Mr. Reyansh uses 56000 liters for his sheep + 22400 liters for his cows = <<56000+22400=78400>>78400 liters of water in a week.
