In total, how many students in this teacher's class prefer dogs over cats?\n\nIf 50% of students chose dogs and video games, and 10% of students chose dogs and movies, then if we want the total percentage of students that prefer dogs over cats, we can just add these two percentages: 50% + 10% = 60% of students prefer dogs.\nSince 30 students are in the class, then to find the number of students that prefer dogs, we just multiply 60/100 * 30 = <<60/100*30=18>>18 students.

How much can he save by paying cash?\n\nBy paying cash, Mr. Roberts can save $120 down payment + $30/month * 12 months = $<<120+30*12=480>>480.\nTherefore, he can save $480 - $400 = $<<480-400=80>>80 by paying cash. Answer: \\boxed{80}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mrs. Taylor bought two smart televisions that cost $650 each. If the total sales price had a 25% discount, how much did Mrs. Taylor pay for the two televisions?\n\nThe discount on each television is $650 x 25/100 = $<<650*25/100=162.5>>162.5.\nEach television costs $650 - $162.5 = $<<650-162.5=487.5>>487.5 after the discount.\nSo, Mrs. Taylor paid $487.5 x 2 = $<<487.5*2=975>>975 for the two televisions. Answer: \\boxed{975}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mr. Roberts can buy a television for $400 cash or $120 down payment and $30 a month for 12 months. How much can he save by paying cash?\n\nIf Mr. Roberts pays $30 a month for 12 months, he will pay a total of $30/month * 12 months = $<<30*12=360>>360.\nIf he pays $120 down payment and $30 a month for 12 months, he will pay a total of $360 + $120 = $<<360+120=480>>480.\nThus, he can save $480 - $400 = $<<480-400=80>>80 by paying cash.

Five of the layers are limestone. Half of the rest are sandstone. Four of the remaining are quartz. Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nLet's work through the information provided step by step.\nWe know that there are 25 different layers in total.\nOut of these 25 layers, 5 are limestone, which means that there are 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 layers remaining.\nHalf of the rest are sandstone, so there are 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 layers of sandstone.\nNow there are 20 - 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 layers left, which are not limestone or sandstone.\nFour of these remaining layers are quartz, so there are 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 layers left that are not limestone, sandstone, or quartz.\nOut of these 6 layers, half are shale, which means there are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 layers of shale.\nFinally, the remaining layers are all different kinds of rock. These are 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 layers.\nTherefore, there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 25 different layers of rock in a canyon\u2019s strata. Five of the layers are limestone. Half of the rest are sandstone. Four of the remaining are quartz. Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nIf there are 25 layers of rock and 5 are limestone, then there are 25-5 = <<25-5=20>>20 layers of rock that are not limestone.\nIf half of the rest are sandstone, then there are 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 layers of rock that are not limestone or sandstone.\nIf 4 of the remaining are quartz, then there are 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 layers of rock that are not limestone, sandstone, or quartz.\nIf half of the rest are shale, then there are 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 layers of rock that are not limestone, sandstone, quartz, or shale.\nTherefore, there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the strata.

How many marbles are red?\n\nHalf of the marbles are white, so there are 1/2 * 50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25 white marbles.\nThere are 50% fewer green balls than yellow balls, which means there are 50/100 * 12 = <<50/100*12=6>>6 fewer green balls.\nSo there are 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 green balls.\nThat leaves 50 - 25 - 12 - 6 = <<50-25-12-6=7>>7 red balls. Answer: \\boxed{7}.\n\n\nQuestion: George collected 50 marbles in white, yellow, green, and red. Half of them are white, and 12 are yellow. There are 50% fewer green balls than yellow balls. How many marbles are red?\n\nWhite balls are half, so there are 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 white balls.\nSo in total 50 - 25 - 12 = <<50-25-12=13>>13 green and red balls are.\nLet's say that the number of red balls is r.\nThe number of green balls is 12 - 50% * 12 = 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 balls.\nWe know that green + red = 13.\nThus 6 + r = <<6+r=13>>13 balls in total.\nSo the number of red balls is r = 13 - 6 = <<13-6=7>>7. Answer: \\boxed{7}.\n\n\nQuestion: Nadine collected different colored pebbles. She has 20 white pebbles and half as many red pebbles. How many pebbles does she have in all?\n\nNadine has half as many red pebbles as white pebbles, which means she has 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 red pebbles.\nThe total number of pebbles that Nadine has is 10+20 = <<10+20=30>>30 pebbles. Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: Three baskets A, B and C contain different numbers of differently colored marbles. Basket A contains 4 red marbles and 2 yellow marbles. Basket B contains 6 green marbles and 1 yellow marble. Basket C contains 3 white marbles and 9 yellow marbles. What is the difference between the number of each color of marble in the basket that has the greatest difference?\n", "text": "Let's compare the number of each color of marble in each basket:\n\nBasket A: 4 red marbles, 2 yellow marbles\nBasket B: 6 green marbles, 1 yellow marble\nBasket C: 3 white marbles, 9 yellow marbles\n\nThe greatest difference between the number of each color of marble is found in Basket C. \nIn Basket C, there is a difference of 9 - 3 = <<9-3=6>>6 yellow marbles.\nTherefore, the difference between the number of each color of marble in the basket with the greatest difference is 6.
