Currently the primer is $30.00 a gallon and they are offering 20% off.  The paint costs $25.00 a gallon and is not on sale.  How much will he spend on paint and primer?\n", "text": "Each room requires a gallon of primer and a gallon of paint, so for 5 rooms, Blake will need 5 gallons of primer and 5 gallons of paint.\nThe cost of the primer is $30.00 per gallon, with a 20% discount. So, the discounted price of one gallon of primer is $30.00 - (20% of $30.00) = $30.00 - ($6.00) = $24.00.\nTherefore, the cost of 5 gallons of primer is 5 x $24.00 = $120.00.\nThe cost of one gallon of paint is $25.00, and Blake needs 5 gallons of paint, so the total cost of paint is 5 x $25.00 = $125.00.\nTherefore, Blake will spend a total of $120.00 + $125.00 = $245.00 on paint and primer.
