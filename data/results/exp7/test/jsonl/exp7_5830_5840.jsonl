If Betty has 12 oranges, how many oranges does Emily have?\n\nSandra has 3 * 12 oranges = <<3*12=36>>36 oranges.\nEmily has 7 * 36 oranges = <<7*36=252>>252 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{252}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark and Peter dug ponds in their backyards. Mark\u2019s pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times Peter\u2019s pond. If Mark\u2019s pond is 19 feet deep, what is the depth of Peter\u2019s pond?\n", "text": "Mark\u2019s pond is 4 feet deeper than 3 times Peter\u2019s pond, so let the depth of Peter's pond be $x$ feet. Then, 3 times Peter\u2019s pond is $3x$ feet deep, and Mark\u2019s pond is $3x + 4$ feet deep. We know that Mark\u2019s pond is 19 feet deep, so $3x + 4 = 19$. Solving this equation, we find $3x = 15$ and then $x = 5$. Therefore, the depth of Peter\u2019s pond is $\\boxed{5}$ feet."}

The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes. Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations.
