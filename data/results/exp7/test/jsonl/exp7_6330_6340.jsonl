The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes. Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations.

While at the store, Sofia's father calls and says they're to add 5 more kgs since their neighbor also wanted some supplies. When they reach home, they estimated that for the next coming two weeks they'll have to buy twice as many oranges each week for the supplies to be enough. What the total quantity of oranges they would have bought after the three weeks.\n", "text": "Initially, Sofia and her mother bought 10 kgs of oranges. Then, they added 5 more kgs, bringing the total to 10 kgs + 5 kgs = <<10+5=15>>15 kgs. \n\nFor the next two weeks, they need to buy twice as many oranges each week. So, the quantity they would have bought for each of the two weeks is 15 kgs * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 kgs of oranges.\n\nTherefore, the total quantity of oranges they would have bought after the three weeks is 15 kgs + 30 kgs + 30 kgs = <<15+30+30=75>>75 kgs. Answer: \\boxed{75}."}
