Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nJustine initially had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, so let's assume Bailey had x rubber bands.\nSo, Justine had x + 10 rubber bands.\nJustine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, so Ylona had x + 10 + 2 = x + 12 rubber bands.\nBailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona so he had x - 2 - 2 = x - 4 rubber bands.\nSince Bailey is left with 8 rubber bands, we have x - 4 = 8.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get x = 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nSo Ylona initially had x + 12 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 rubber bands. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lena has 16 candy bars. She needs 5 more candy bars to have 3 times as many as Kevin, and Kevin has 4 candy bars less than Nicole. How many more candy bars does Lena have than Nicole?\n", "text": "If Kevin has k candy bars, then Nicole has k + 4 candy bars.\nTo have 3 times as many candy bars as Kevin, Lena needs 3k candy bars.\nLena needs 5 more candy bars than she currently has, so she needs 16 + 5 = 21 candy bars.\nThus, we have the equation 21 = 3k.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get k = 7.\nTherefore, Nicole has 7 + 4 = <<7+4=11>>11 candy bars.\nLena has 16 candy bars, so she has 16 - 11 = <<16-11=5>>5 more candy bars than Nicole. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations.

And the third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat.  What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?\n\nIf the first cat is meowing 3 times per minute, then after 5 minutes it has meowed 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 times.\nIf the second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat, then it meows 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times per minute.\nAfter 5 minutes of meowing at this rate, the second cat has meowed 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 times.\nIf the third cat meows at one-third the rate of the second cat, then it meows 6/3=<<6/3=2>>2 times per minute.\nAfter 5 minutes of meowing at this rate, the third cat has meowed 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 times.\nThe combined total number of meows from the three cats over 5 minutes is 15+30+10=<<15+30+10=55>>55 meows.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby rotates 400 baseballs because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend rotates 404 apples because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nHis friend wins because 404 > 400.\nThe winner rotates 404 objects.

It then travels the whole width of the lake at the same speed, which takes 30 minutes. How many square miles is the lake?\n", "text": "Given that the boat takes 2 hours to go across the length of the lake and travels at a speed of 10 mph, the length of the lake must be 2 hours * 10 mph = 20 miles. \n\nSimilarly, the boat takes 30 minutes to travel the width of the lake, which is equivalent to 30/60 = 0.5 hours. \n\nSince the boat travels at a speed of 10 mph, the width of the lake is 0.5 hours * 10 mph = 5 miles. \n\nTherefore, the area of the lake is calculated by multiplying the length and the width: 20 miles * 5 miles = 100 square miles. \n\nHence, the lake is 100 square miles in size. Answer: \\boxed{100}."}
