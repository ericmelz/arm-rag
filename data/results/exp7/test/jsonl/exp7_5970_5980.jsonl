If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\n\nIf Amy got $50, and the ratio of the sharing is 2:1:3, then Sandra received $50*(2/1) = $<<50*(2/1)=100>>100. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: A group of parents get together and decide to hire a private school teacher to quit his job and teach their children.  His former job paid 45,000 per year and they offered him a 20% raise.  If there are 9 kids how much does each parent have to pay?\n", "text": "If the teacher's former job paid $45,000 per year, his new salary with a 20% raise would be $45,000 + ($45,000 * 0.20) = $<<45000+45000*0.20=54000>>54,000 per year. \n\nIf there are 9 kids and all the parents are sharing the cost equally, each parent would have to pay $54,000 / 9 = $<<54000/9=6000>>6,000 per year. \n\nEach parent has to pay $6,000. Answer: \\boxed{6,000}."}

How many oranges did Alice sell?\n\nLet's say Emily sold x oranges.\nAlice sold 2*x oranges.\nIn total, they sold x + 2*x = 180 oranges.\nThis translates to 3*x = 180 oranges.\nTherefore, Emily sold x = 180 / 3 = <<180/3=60>>60 oranges.\nAlice sold 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{120}.\n\n\nQuestion: Ephraim has two machines that make necklaces for his store. On Sunday the first machine made 45 necklaces. The second machine made 2.4 times as many necklaces as the first machine. How many necklaces were made in total on Sunday?\n\nThe second machine made 45 x 2.4 = <<45*2.4=108>>108 necklaces.\nSo, 45 + 108 = <<45+108=153>>153 necklaces were made in total on Sunday. Answer: \\boxed{153}.\n\n\nQuestion: Caitlin makes bracelets to sell at the farmer\u2019s market every weekend. Each bracelet takes twice as many small beads as it does large beads. If each bracelet uses 12 large beads, and Caitlin has 528 beads with equal amounts of large and small beads, how many bracelets can she make for this weekend?\n", "text": "If each bracelet uses 12 large beads, then it would also use 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 small beads.\nSince Caitlin has an equal amount of large and small beads, she has a total of 528 beads / 2 = <<528/2=264>>264 beads of each type.\nTherefore, Caitlin can make a total of 264 beads / 24 beads per bracelet = <<264/24=11>>11 bracelets for this weekend. Answer: \\boxed{11}."}
