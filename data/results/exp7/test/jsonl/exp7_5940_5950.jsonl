Dr. Juan has asked her to strengthen her bones by drinking 105 gallons of milk within 3 weeks. Flora thinks that drinking 3 gallons of milk daily will be enough, but her brother says she'll still need to drink more. To fulfill Dr. Juan\u2019s requirement, how many more gallons must Flora drink daily?\n\nIn 3 weeks, there are 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 days.\nTo drink 105 gallons of milk within 3 weeks, Flora must drink 105 / 21 = <<105/21=5>>5 gallons daily.\nSo, Flora must drink 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 more gallons daily.

She filled three containers with two liters each, two containers with 0.75 liters each, and five containers with 0.5 liters each. How many liters of milk did Josephine sell in total?\n\nJosephine sold 3 \u00d7 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 liters with three containers.\nShe sold 2 \u00d7 0.75 = <<2*0.75=1.5>>1.5 liters with two containers.\nAnd she sold 5 \u00d7 0.5 = <<5*0.5=2.5>>2.5 liters with five containers.\nJosephine sold a total of 6 + 1.5 + 2.5 = <<6+1.5+2.5=10>>10 liters of milk.

This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?\n\nMrs. Lim got a total of 68 + 82 = <<68+82=150>>150 gallons of milk yesterday.\nShe got 68 - 18 = <<68-18=50>>50 gallons of milk this morning.\nSo, she got a total of 150 + 50 = <<150+50=200>>200 gallons of milk.\nShe sold 200 - 24 = <<200-24=176>>176 gallons of milk.\nTherefore, her revenue for the milk is $3.50 x 176 = $<<3.5*176=616>>616.

If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of women at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 is (40/100)*200 = <<40/100*200=80>>80.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of women wearing rabbit ears. We know that 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 is (80/100)*80 = <<80/100*80=64>>64.\nThen, we need to calculate the number of men at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200, and 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of men wearing rabbit ears. We know that 60% of the men are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 is (60/100)*120 = <<60/100*120=72>>72.\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of people wearing rabbit ears by adding the number of women wearing rabbit ears (64) and the number of men wearing rabbit ears (72), which is 64 + 72 = <<64+72=136>>136.

If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nLet's start by finding out how many women are at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 guests is (40/100)*200 = <<(40/100)*200=80>>80 women.\nOut of the 80 women, 80% are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 women is (80/100)*80 = <<(80/100)*80=64>>64 women.\nNow let's find out how many men are at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200 and that 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 men.\nOut of the 120 men, 60% are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 men is (60/100)*120 = <<(60/100)*120=72>>72 men.\nThe total number of people wearing rabbit ears is 64 women + 72 men = <<64+72=136>>136 people.

Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20. If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nSince Coraline's number is 80, Jayden's number is 80-40 = <<80-40=40>>40\nIf Mickey's number is 20 more than Jayden's number, his number is 40+20 = <<20+40=60>>60\nThe total of the numbers the three have is 80+40+60 = <<80+40+60=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater. If the capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons and it's 3/4 full, calculate the total number of gallons of water they both have if Catherine's water heater is also full with water to 3/4 of its capacity.\n", "text": "If Wallace's water heater is 3/4 full and has a capacity of 40 gallons, then the amount of water in it is 3/4 * 40 = 30 gallons.\nSince Catherine's water heater is twice the size of Wallace's, it has a capacity of 40/2 = 20 gallons.\nIf Catherine's water heater is 3/4 full, then the amount of water in it is 3/4 * 20 = 15 gallons.\nThe total number of gallons of water they both have is 30 + 15 = 45 gallons. Answer: \\boxed{45}."}

He sold the house to Mr. Brown at a profit of 10%. After one year, Mr. Brown sold the house to his other friend with a 10% loss. How much was Mr. Brown's selling price?\n\nMr. Grey's profit is $100,000 x 10/100 = $<<100000*10/100=10000>>10,000.\nSo, Mr. Grey sold the house to Mr. Brown for $100,000 + $10,000 = $<<100000+10000=110000>>110,000.\nMr. Brown's loss is $110,000 x 10/100 = $<<110000*10/100=11000>>11,000.\nTherefore, Mr. Brown sold the house for $110,000 - $11,000 = $<<110000-11000=99000>>99,000. Answer: \\boxed{99000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason's stove catches on fire. Buying a replacement will cost $1200 and fixing the damage to the wall behind it will cost 1/6th as much. How much does he spend in total?\n\nThe damage to the wall costs $1200 / 6 = $<<1200/6=200>>200 to fix.\nThus in total Jason spends $1200 + $200 = $<<1200+200=1400>>1400. Answer: \\boxed{1400}.\n\n\nQuestion: Sophie buys five cupcakes at $2 each,  six doughnuts at $1 each,  four slices of apple pie at $2 per slice, and fifteen cookies at $0.60 each. How much does she spend in all?\n\nThe cost of cupcakes is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThe cost of doughnuts is 6 x $1 = $<<6*1=6>>6.\nThe cost of apple pie is 4 x $2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nThe cost of cookies is 15 x $0.60 = $<<15*0.60=9>>9.\nTherefore, Sophie spends $10 + $6 + $8 + $9 = $<<10+6+8+9=33>>33. Answer: \\boxed{33}.\n\n\nQuestion: Whitney\u2019s mom gave her two $20 bills to spend at the school book fair. Whitney has decided to buy 2 posters, 3 notebooks, and 2 bookmarks. Each poster costs $5, each notebook costs $4, and each bookmark costs $2. How much money, in dollars, will Whitney have left over after the purchase?\n\nThe cost of the two posters is 2 posters * $5/poster = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nThe cost of the three notebooks is 3 notebooks * $4/notebook = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nThe cost of the two bookmarks is 2 bookmarks * $2/bookmark = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nThe total cost of the purchase is $10 + $12 + $4 = $<<10+12+4=26>>26.\nWhitney will have $40\u2013$26 = $<<40-26=14>>14 left after the purchase.

The costs are as follows: land costs $50 per square meter, bricks cost $100 per 1000 bricks and roof tiles cost $10 per roof tile. If the house they wish to build requires 2000 square meters, 10000 bricks, and 500 roof tiles, how much construction costs are required for this project?\n", "text": "The cost of the land is $50 x 2000 = $<<50*2000=100000>>100,000.\nThe cost of the bricks is $100 x (10000/1000) = $<<100*(10000/1000)=1000>>1000.\nThe cost of the roof tiles is $10 x 500 = $<<10*500=5000>>5000.\nTherefore, the total construction costs for this project is $100000 + $1000 + $5000 = $<<100000+1000+5000=106000>>106,000. Answer: \\boxed{106000}."}
