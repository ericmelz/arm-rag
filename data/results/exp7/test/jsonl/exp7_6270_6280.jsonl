On the weekend, 56 customers ordered apple pie slices and 48 customers ordered peach pie slices.  How many pies did Milton sell during the weekend?\n", "text": "The number of apple pie slices sold is 56 customers * 1 slice/customer = <<56*1=56>>56 slices.\nThe number of peach pie slices sold is 48 customers * 1 slice/customer = <<48*1=48>>48 slices.\nTo find the number of apple pies sold, divide the number of apple pie slices by the number of slices per pie: 56 slices / 8 slices per pie = <<56/8=7>>7 pies.\nTo find the number of peach pies sold, divide the number of peach pie slices by the number of slices per pie: 48 slices / 6 slices per pie = <<48/6=8>>8 pies.\nTherefore, Milton sold a total of 7 apple pies + 8 peach pies = <<7+8=15>>15 pies during the weekend.
