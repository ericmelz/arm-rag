Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?\n", "text": "Each pebble creates a splash that is 1/4 meter wide.\nEach rock creates a splash that is 1/2 meter wide.\nEach boulder creates a splash that is 2 meters wide.\n\nTreQuan throws 6 pebbles, so the total width of the pebble splashes is 6 * 1/4 meter = 6/4 meter = 1.5 meters.\nTreQuan throws 3 rocks, so the total width of the rock splashes is 3 * 1/2 meter = 3/2 meter = 1.5 meters.\nTreQuan throws 2 boulders, so the total width of the boulder splashes is 2 * 2 meters = 4 meters.\n\nTherefore, the total width of all the splashes is 1.5 meters + 1.5 meters + 4 meters = 7 meters.

Half of her spots are located on her upper torso, with one-third of the spots located on her back and hindquarters, and the remaining spots located on her sides.  If Jean has 30 spots on her upper torso, how many spots does she have located on her sides?\n", "text": "Let's denote the total number of spots on Jean's upper torso as $x$. Since half of her spots are located on her upper torso, we have the equation:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}x = 30$\n\nTo find the number of spots located on her sides, we need to subtract the spots on her upper torso from the total number of spots. Since one-third of the spots are located on her back and hindquarters, the remaining spots are on her sides. So, the number of spots on her sides is:\n\n$x - \\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{1}{3}x$\n\nSubstituting the value of $x$ from the first equation, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 30 = 10$\n\nTherefore, Jean has 10 spots located on her sides.
