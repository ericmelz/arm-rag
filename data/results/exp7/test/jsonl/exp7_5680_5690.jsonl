How many miles did Harriet run?\n", "text": "Let's call the distance that Tomas, Tyler, and Harriet each ran \"x\". We know that Katarina ran 51 miles. So, the total distance that the four runners ran is 51 + x + x + x = 195. Simplifying this equation, we get 51 + 3x = 195. To solve for x, we can subtract 51 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 3x = 144. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 48. Since Harriet ran the same distance as Tomas and Tyler, she also ran x miles, which is 48 miles. Answer: \\boxed{48}."}

The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\n\nIn one minute, the white rabbit can hop 15 meters and the brown rabbit can hop 12 meters. So in 5 minutes, the white rabbit will cover 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters.\nSimilarly, the brown rabbit will cover 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters.\nThe total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes is 75 meters + 60 meters = <<75+60=135>>135 meters.

If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare would need to run 20 feet in the same amount of time it takes the turtle to crawl 20 feet. \nSince the hare runs 10 feet/second, it would take 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds for the hare to run the 20 feet.\nSince the turtle crawls 1 foot/second, it would take 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds for the turtle to crawl the 20 feet.\nThus, the turtle needs a head start of 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds to finish in a tie.
