They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?\n\nIf Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, and Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, then Jolyn is 2+5=<<2+5=7>>7 months older than Aivo.\nTherefore, Jolyn is 7 months older than Aivo who is 2 months younger than Leon. This means that Jolyn is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 months older than Leon. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Four classmates were comparing their ages based on their birth month. They found out that Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese while Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Then, Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. How much older in months is Jolyn than Leon?\n\nBased on the given information, we can outline the ages of the four classmates as follows:\n\nAivo\nTherese (Aivo + 5)\nJolyn (Therese + 2)\nLeon (Aivo + 2)\n\nThus, Jolyn is (Aivo + 5 + 2) = (Aivo + 7) months older than Aivo. Similarly, Leon is (Aivo + 2) months older than Aivo.\n\nTo find the age difference between Jolyn and Leon, we subtract the expressions representing their ages:\n\nJolyn - Leon = (Aivo + 7) - (Aivo + 2)\n= Aivo + 7 - Aivo - 2\n= 7 - 2\n= 5.\n\nSo, Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon.

Since Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank, Frank's age is x + 3. \nThe current total of their ages is 17, so x + (x + 3) = 17.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 2x + 3 = 17.\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get 2x = 14.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 7.\nTherefore, Frank's age is x + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10.

If each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll\u2019s age, how old is the fifth scroll?\n\nLet's represent the age of the first scroll as x.\nTherefore, the second scroll is x + x/2 = 3x/2 years old.\nThe third scroll is (3x/2) + (3x/4) = 9x/4 years old.\nThe fourth scroll is (9x/4) + (9x/8) = 27x/8 years old.\nThe fifth scroll is (27x/8) + (27x/16) = 81x/16 years old.\nSince x represents the age of the first scroll, x = 4080 years.\nTherefore, the fifth scroll is (81 * 4080) / 16 = <<(81*4080)/16=20655>>20655 years old.
