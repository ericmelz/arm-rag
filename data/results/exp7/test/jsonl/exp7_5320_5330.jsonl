If the dog is 30 inches long overall, how long is its tail?\n\nLet T be the length of the tail.\nThe body is 2T.\nThe head is (1/6)*(2T)=T/3.\nThe total length is T+(T/3)+(2T)=30.\nCombining like terms, we get T+(T/3)+(2T)=30\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get 3T+T+6T=90\nCombining like terms, we get 10T=90\nDividing both sides by 10, we get T=<<9=9>>9.

If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare would need to run 20 feet in the same amount of time it takes the turtle to crawl 20 feet. \nSince the hare runs 10 feet/second, it would take 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds for the hare to run the 20 feet.\nSince the turtle crawls 1 foot/second, it would take 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds for the turtle to crawl the 20 feet.\nThus, the turtle needs a head start of 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds to finish in a tie.

Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: A park has three colors of flowering crepe myrtle trees planted: red, white, and pink. When they bloom, a third of them are pink, but only two are red. Most of them are white. There are 42 crepe myrtle trees in the park. How many have white flowers when they bloom?\n", "text": "If there are 42 crepe myrtle trees in the park and a third of them are pink, then there are 42/3 = <<14=14>>14 pink crepe myrtle trees.\nIf only two of the crepe myrtle trees are red, then there are 14+2 = <<14+2=16>>16 pink and red crepe myrtle trees.\nThe remaining trees must be white, so there are 42-16 = <<42-16=26>>26 white crepe myrtle trees. Answer: \\boxed{26}."}
