In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume that there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nSince each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head, the total number of legs and heads in the flock is 3x (legs) + x (heads) = 20.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find that x, or the number of tripodasauruses in the flock, is 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5.

The number of elephants is half the number of parrots and snakes added up, and there are 3 fewer zebras than elephants. What is the difference in number between the zebras and the monkeys?\n\nThe number of snakes is 8*3=<<8*3=24>>24.\nThe number of monkeys is 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48.\nThe number of parrots and snakes is 8+24=<<8+24=32>>32.\nThe number of elephants is 32/2=<<32/2=16>>16.\nThe number of zebras is 16-3=<<16-3=13>>13.\nThe difference between the number of zebras and monkeys is 48-13=<<48-13=35>>35.

How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume the number of tripodasauruses in the flock is x.\nSince each tripodasaurus has three legs, the total number of legs in the flock is 3x.\nSimilarly, the total number of heads in the flock is also x.\nTherefore, 3x + x = 20 (the total number of heads and legs in the flock is 20)\n4x = 20\nx = 20/4\nx = 5\nTherefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: The tripodasaurus has three legs. In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nEach tripodasaurus has one head and three legs, so in total, there are 1*x = x heads.\nAdditionally, each tripodasaurus has three legs, so the total number of legs is 3*x = 3x.\nThe problem states that the total number of heads and legs is 20, therefore we have the equation x + 3x = 20.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find x = 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nThere are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 200 snakes in a park. There are three times as many pythons as boa constrictors. If there 40 boa constrictors and the rest of the snakes are rattlesnakes, calculate the total number of rattlesnakes in the park.\n\nThe number of pythons is three times the number of boa constrictors, meaning there are 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 pythons\nThe total number of pythons and boa constrictors in the park is 120+40 = <<120+40=160>>160\nThere are 200-160 = <<200-160=40>>40 rattlesnakes in the park.

And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nPolly stands for three times as long as Pulsar, for 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nPetra stands for one-sixth as long as Polly, which is 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 minutes.\nThus, the total time for all three entertainers is 10+30+5=<<10+30+5=45>>45 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{45}.\n\n\nQuestion: James has an old printer that crumples every seventh page and blurs the ink on every third page. If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, which means it crumples 42 / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages.\nThe printer blurs the ink on every third page, which means it blurs 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages.\nHowever, some pages are both crumpled and blurred, so we need to subtract these from the total. This is because the crumpled pages are a multiple of 7, and the blurred pages are a multiple of 3, thus the multiples of the lowest common multiple are the duplicates. The printer crumples and blurs on every 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pages.\nThus, we must subtract the pages that are both crumpled and blurred, which is 42 / 21 = <<42/21=2>>2 pages.\nSo in total, he has 42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.
