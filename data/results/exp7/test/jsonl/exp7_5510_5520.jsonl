How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 oranges is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe first boy remains with 12 oranges - 4 oranges = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges after giving out some to his brother.\nOne-fourth of 8 oranges is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Aaron has some brothers. Bennett has 6 brothers. If the number of Bennett's brothers is two less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers, what is the number of Aaron's brothers?\n", "text": "Let the number of Aaron's brothers be x.\nAccording to the problem, the number of Bennett's brothers is two less than twice the number of Aaron's brothers, so 6 = 2x - 2.\nAdding 2 to both sides of the equation, we have 6 + 2 = 2x.\nSimplifying, 8 = 2x.\nDividing both sides by 2, we have x = 8/2 = 4.\nTherefore, the number of Aaron's brothers is 4. Answer: \\boxed{4}."}

If the Magnet cost $3, how much, in dollars, did a single stuffed animal cost?\n\nThe magnet cost three times more than the sticker, so more exactly it was 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dollars more.\nThus the two stuffed animals cost 3+9=<<3+9=12>>12 dollars at the garage sale.\nTherefore, a single stuffed animal would cost 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 dollars each. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: A kiddy gift shop sells bracelets at $4 each, keychains at $5 each, and coloring books at $3 each. Paula and Olive want to buy presents for their friends. Paula buys two bracelets and a keychain, while Olive buys a coloring book and a bracelet.  How much do Paula and Olive spend in total?\n\nTwo bracelets cost 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nSo Paula spends $8 + $5 = $<<8+5=13>>13.\nWhile Olive spends $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7>>7.\nTherefore, Paula and Olive spend $13 + $7 = $<<13+7=20>>20 in total.

Robert buys 4 pens. If one pen costs $1.50, how much money did the three friends spend in total on pens?\n\nJulia bought 3 * 4 pens = <<3*4=12>>12 pens.\nDorothy bought 12 pens / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pens.\nThe total cost of the pens is 4 pens * $1.50 per pen + 12 pens * $1.50 per pen + 6 pens * $1.50 per pen = $6 + $18 + $9.\nThe three friends spent a total of $<<6+18+9=33>>33 on pens. Answer: \\boxed{33}.\n\n\nQuestion: Hank is raising money for the local homeless shelter. Hank makes $100 in a carwash and donates 90% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Hank makes $80 in a bake sale and donates 75% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. Then he makes $50 mowing lawns and donates 100% of the proceeds to the local homeless shelter. How much money does Hank donate in total?\n\nFrom the carwash, Hank donates 100 * 0.9 = $<<100*0.9=90>>90.\nFrom the bake sale, Hank donates 80 * 0.75 = $<<80*0.75=60>>60.\nFrom mowing lawns, Hank donates 50 * 1 = $<<50*1=50>>50.\nIn total, Hank donates 90 + 60 + 50 = $<<90+60+50=200>>200 to the local homeless shelter. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: For a class fundraiser, 30 students were asked to bring in 12 brownies each.  20 students were asked to bring in 24 cookies each and 15 students were asked to bring in 12 donuts each.  If they sell everything for $2.00 each, how much money will they raise?\n", "text": "The total number of brownies brought in is 30 * 12 = <<30*12=360>>360.\nThe total number of cookies brought in is 20 * 24 = <<20*24=480>>480.\nThe total number of donuts brought in is 15 * 12 = <<15*12=180>>180.\nThe total number of items brought in is 360 + 480 + 180 = <<360+480+180=1020>>1020.\nSince each item is sold for $2, the fundraiser will raise a total of $2 * 1020 = $<<2*1020=2040>>2040.
