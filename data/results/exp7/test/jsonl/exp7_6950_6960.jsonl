If he is left with $405, how much were his earnings?\n\nIf Kenneth spent 10% of his earnings this week, he is left with 100% - 10% = <<100-10=90>>90% of his earnings.\nIf 90% of his earnings is equal to $405, then each 1% is equal to $405/90 = $<<405/90=4.5>>4.5.\nTherefore, Kenneth's earnings are equal to $4.5 x 100% = $<<4.5*100=450>>450. Answer: \\boxed{450}.\n\n\nQuestion: Kenneth spent 10% of this earnings this week on a new joystick. If he is left with $405, how much were his earnings?\n\nLet's assume Kenneth's earnings were x dollars.\nHe spent 10% of his earnings, which is 10/100*x = x/10 dollars.\nAfter buying the joystick, he is left with x - x/10 = 9x/10 dollars.\nGiven that he is left with $405, we can equate this to 9x/10 dollars: 9x/10 = $405.\nMultiplying both sides by 10/9, we get x = $450.\nTherefore, Kenneth's earnings were $450.
