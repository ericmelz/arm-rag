Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats. If Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, how many did Matthew eat?\n\nIf Patrick ate half as many egg rolls as Alvin, since Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, Patrick ate 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 egg rolls.\nMatthew ate three times as many egg rolls as Patrick, a total of 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 egg rolls. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tony made a sandwich with two slices of bread for lunch every day this week. On Saturday, he was extra hungry from doing yard work and made two sandwiches. How many slices of bread are left from the 22-slice loaf Tony started with?\n", "text": "Tony made 2 sandwiches on Saturday, so he used 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices of bread.\nFor the other 6 days of the week, Tony made 1 sandwich each day, using 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 slices of bread.\nIn total, Tony used 4 + 12 = <<4+12=16>>16 slices of bread.\nTherefore, Tony has 22 - 16 = <<22-16=6>>6 slices of bread left. Answer: \\boxed{6}."}

If the dog is 30 inches long overall, how long is its tail?\n\nLet T be the length of the tail.\nThe body is 2T.\nThe head is (1/6)*(2T)=T/3.\nThe total length is T+(T/3)+(2T)=30.\nCombining like terms, we get T+(T/3)+(2T)=30\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get 3T+T+6T=90\nCombining like terms, we get 10T=90\nDividing both sides by 10, we get T=<<9=9>>9. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe remainder is 12-4 = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges.\nOne-fourth of 8 is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Carter has a jar with 20 green M&Ms and 20 red M&Ms. He eats 12 of the green M&Ms, then his sister comes and eats half the red M&Ms and adds 14 yellow M&Ms. If Carter picks an M&M at random now, what is the percentage chance he'll get a green M&M?\n\nAfter eating 12 green M&Ms, Carter has 20 - 12 = <<20-12=8>>8 remaining green M&Ms.\nAfter his sister eats half the red M&Ms, there are 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 remaining red M&Ms.\nAfter adding the yellow M&Ms, there are 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 total yellow and red M&Ms.\nThere are a total 8 + 24 = <<8+24=32>>32 green and yellow M&Ms.\nThus, Carter has an 8/32 = <<8/32=0.25>>0.25 or 25% chance of picking a green M&M. Answer: \\boxed{25}.\n\n\nQuestion: A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 oranges is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe first boy remains with 12 oranges - 4 oranges = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges after giving out some to his brother.\nOne-fourth of 8 oranges is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20. If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nIf Coraline's number is 80, Jayden's number is 80-40 = <<80-40=40>>40\nMickey's number is 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 which is 20 greater than Jayden's number.\nJayden's number is 60-20 = <<60-20=40>>40\nTogether, the three have 60+40+80 = <<60+40+80=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Purple Valley has one-quarter as many skirts as Seafoam Valley, and Seafoam Valley has two-thirds as many skirts as Azure Valley.
