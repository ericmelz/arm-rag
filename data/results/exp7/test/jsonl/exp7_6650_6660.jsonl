Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats. If Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, how many did Matthew eat?\n\nIf Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, since Patrick ate half as many egg rolls as Alvin ate, Patrick ate 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 egg rolls.\nThe total number of egg rolls that Patrick and Alvin ate is 2+4 = <<2+4=6>>6 egg rolls.\nMatthew ate three times as many egg rolls as Patrick ate, meaning he ate 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 egg rolls.
