If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nIf Coraline's number is 80, and Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, Jayden's number is 80-40=<<80-40=40>>40\nThe total number of numbers is Mickey's number, which is 20 more than Jayden's number by exactly 20\nMickey's number is 40+20=<<40+20=60>>60\nIn total, the three numbers sum up to 40+60+80=<<40+60+80=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Marky owns a computer accessory shop. For this month, half of their sales are wireless mice, one-fourth are optical mice, and the rest are trackball mice. If Marky's shop was able to sell a total of 80 mice, how many of them are trackball mice?\n\nThe shop sold 80/2 = <<80/2=40>>40 wireless mice.\nThe shop sold 80/4 = <<80/4=20>>20 optical mice.\nSo, Marky's shop sold 40 + 20 = <<40+20=60>>60 wireless and optical mice.\nHence, there were 80 - 60 = <<80-60=20>>20 trackball mice sold. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Marky owns a computer accessory shop. For this month, half of their sales are wireless mice, one-fourth are optical mice, and the rest are trackball mice.
