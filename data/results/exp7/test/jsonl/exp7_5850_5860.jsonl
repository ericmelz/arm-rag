If the temperature averages 90 degrees F for 80% of the time, then he will be eating 4 crickets 80% of the time.

This means he will be eating 2 * 4 = 8 crickets per week for the remaining 15 weeks - 12 weeks = 3 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Gilbert will eat 12 weeks * 4 crickets/week + 3 weeks * 8 crickets/week = 48 crickets + 24 crickets = <<12*4+3*8=72>>72 crickets over 15 weeks.

Then she decided she wouldn't use it anyway and sold it for $255. What percentage of the initial cost did she lose?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of money she lost. We do this by subtracting the amount she sold it for from the amount that she bought it for: $300 - $255 = $<<300-255=45>>45.\nNext, we need to determine what percentage of $300 is $45. We do this by dividing the amount she lost by the initial cost and multiplying by 100: ($45 / $300) * 100% = 15%. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Monika went out for the day and spent some money.

Then she stopped by the farmer's market on her way home and got 20 bags of beans at $1.25/bag. How much money did Monika spend throughout her day?\n\nMonika spent $250 at the mall, $24 x 3 = $<<24*3=72>>72 at the movies and 20 x $1.25 = $<<20*1.25=25>>25 at the farmer's market.\nAltogether, Monika spent $250 + $72 + $25 = $<<250+72+25=347>>347 throughout her day.

In the afternoon, she was able to sell 50 apples and 40 oranges. How much are her total sales for the day?\n\nIn the morning, her total sales for apple is $1.50 x 40 = $<<1.5*40=60>>60.\nIn the morning, her total sales for orange is $1 x 30 = $<<1*30=30>>30.\nSo, her total sales in the morning is $60 + $30 = $<<60+30=90>>90.\nIn the afternoon, her total sales for apple is $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.\nIn the afternoon, her total sales for orange is $1 x 40 = $<<1*40=40>>40.\nSo, her total sales in the afternoon is $75 + $40 = $<<75+40=115>>115.\nTherefore, her total sales for the day is $90 + $115 = $<<90+115=205>>205.

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nPolly stands for three times as long as Pulsar, for 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nPetra stands for one-sixth as long as Polly, which is 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 minutes.\nThus, the total time for all three entertainers is 10+30+5=<<10+30+5=45>>45 minutes.

How many minutes longer would it take him to walk 20 miles if he had to take his brother?\n\nIf Derek doesn't have to walk with his brother, it takes him 9 minutes to walk a mile. Therefore, if he has to walk 20 miles without his brother, it would take him 9*20= <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.\nIf he has to walk with his brother, it takes them 12 minutes to walk a mile. Therefore, if they have to walk 20 miles, it would take them 12*20 = <<12*20=240>>240 minutes.\nThe difference in time it takes him to walk 20 miles with his brother and without his brother is 240-180 = <<240-180=60>>60 minutes.

If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, so it crumples $42/7 = 6$ pages. The printer blurs every third page, so it blurs $42/3 = 14$ pages. However, every seventh page is both crumpled and blurred, so we must subtract these cases off to avoid double-counting. Thus, James has $42-6-14 + 2 = \\boxed{24}$ pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.\n\n\nQuestion: In a fruit salad, there are raspberries, green grapes, and red grapes.
