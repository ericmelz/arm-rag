There is currently a $5.00 coupon for this item.  How much will each serving of nuts cost, in cents, after the coupon is applied?\n\nThe bulk bag costs $25.00 and there is a $5.00 coupon so the bulk bag will cost 25-5 = $<<25-5=20.00>>20.00\nEach bag costs $20.00 and holds 40 oz of nuts so each ounce will cost 20/40 = $.50\nThere are 100 cents in a dollar and each nut costs $0.50 so each nut will cost 100*.50 = <<100*.50=50>>50 cents.
