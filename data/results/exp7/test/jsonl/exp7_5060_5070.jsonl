But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Emma bought a loaf of bread that had a certain number of slices. Her little cousin Andy ate 3 slices from the bread at two different points in time, and then Emma decided she would make toast with the remaining slices. If she uses 2 slices of bread to make 1 piece of toast bread, how many slices were in the original loaf if she was able to make 10 pieces of toast bread and had 1 slice of bread left?\n", "text": "Let's call the number of slices in the original loaf \"x\". \n\nEmma's little cousin Andy ate 3 slices from the loaf at two different points in time, so a total of 3 + 3 = 6 slices were eaten. \n\nEmma was able to make 10 pieces of toast bread, and each piece of toast required 2 slices of bread. Therefore, she used a total of 10 * 2 = 20 slices of bread to make the toast. \n\nAfter making the toast, Emma had 1 slice of bread left. \n\nSo, the total number of slices in the original loaf, x, can be found by adding the slices eaten, the slices used for toast, and the remaining slice: x = 6 + 20 + 1 = 27.\n\nTherefore, there were originally 27 slices in the loaf of bread. Answer: \\boxed{27}."}

He buys 10 of them for a \"buy one get one free\" promotion.  They each cost $3.  How much does he pay?\n\nNormally they would cost 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30\nBut since they were buy one get one free, we only charge him for 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5\nSo he pays 5*3=$<<5*3=15>>15.
