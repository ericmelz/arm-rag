Jeremy then gifted Fred an additional 37 goats. If exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, how many male animals are there in the barn?\n\nInitially, Fred had a total of 100 horses + 29 sheep + 9 chickens = <<100+29+9=138>>138 animals in the barn.\nBrian bought half of the animals, so he bought 1/2 * 138 animals = <<1/2*138=69>>69 animals.\nAfter Brian bought half of the animals, there were 138 animals - 69 animals = <<138-69=69>>69 animals left in the barn.\nJeremy gifted an additional 37 goats, so the number of animals in the barn increased to 69 animals + 37 goats = <<69+37=106>>106 animals.\nIf exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, then the number of male animals is 106 animals/2 = <<106/2=53>>53 animals.

Jeremy then gifted Fred an additional 37 goats. If exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, how many male animals are there in the barn?\n\nBrian bought half of the animals in the barn, which means there were 100 + 29 + 9 = <<100+29+9=138>>138 animals in total.\nBrian sold half of these, so he sold 138 / 2 = <<138/2=69>>69 animals.\nThis means there were still 138 - 69 = <<138-69=69>>69 animals remaining in the barn.\nJeremy gifted Fred an additional 37 goats, so there were a total of 69 + 37 = <<69+37=106>>106 animals in the barn.\nExactly half of the animals are male, so there are 106 / 2 = <<106/2=53>>53 male animals in the barn.

If they divide the remaining candies in the bucket equally, how many sourball candies will they each get?\n\nJacob can eat 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 sourball candies.\nLana can eat 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 sourball candies.\nBefore they ate until they cried, they ate 12 + 6 + 3 = <<12+6+3=21>>21 sourball candies.\nThey had 30 - 21 = <<30-21=9>>9 sourball candies left.\nThey will each get 9/3 = <<9/3=3>>3 sourball candies.

Her 8 Guppies each eat half a teaspoon of food. How much food does she have to give to her fish in total?\n\nLayla has 2 Goldfish * 1 teaspoon of food = <<2*1=2>>2 teaspoons of food for her goldfish.\nLayla also has 3 Swordtails * 2 teaspoons of food = <<3*2=6>>6 teaspoons of food for her swordtails.\nLayla's 8 guppies * 0.5 teaspoons of food = <<8*0.5=4>>4 teaspoons of food for her guppies.\nLayla has a total of 2 teaspoons + 6 teaspoons + 4 teaspoons = <<2+6+4=12>>12 teaspoons of fish food.

Her 8 Guppies each eat half a teaspoon of food. How much food does she have to give to her fish in total?\n\nLayla's two Goldfish will eat 2 * 1 teaspoon of food = <<2*1=2>>2 teaspoons.\nHer 3 Swordtails need a total of 3 * 2 teaspoons = <<3*2=6>>6 teaspoons of food.\nHer 8 Guppies need 8 * 1/2 teaspoon = <<8*1/2=4>>4 teaspoons of food.\nSo Layla needs to feed her fish a total of 2 + 6 + 4 = <<2+6+4=12>>12 teaspoons of food.

If there are 28 chocolates left, how many chocolates were in the box?\n", "text": "Let's assume that the total number of chocolates in the box is x.\n\nThe number of chocolates with nuts is x/2.\nThe number of chocolates without nuts is also x/2.\n\nThe students eat 80% of the chocolates with nuts, which is 0.8 * (x/2) = 0.4x.\nThey eat half of the chocolates without nuts, which is 0.5 * (x/2) = 0.25x.\n\nThe total number of chocolates they eat is 0.4x + 0.25x = 0.65x.\nIf there are 28 chocolates left, it means they ate x - 28 chocolates.\n\nSo, we can equate the two expressions:\n0.65x = x - 28.\n\nLet's solve for x:\n0.65x - x = -28,\n-0.35x = -28,\nx = (-28)/(-0.35),\nx = 80.\n\nTherefore, there were 80 chocolates in the box. Answer: \\boxed{80}."}
