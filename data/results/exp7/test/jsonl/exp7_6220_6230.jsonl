Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feed weekly?\n\nIvan\u2019s bird feeder holds two cups of birdseed and gets half a cup taken by a squirrel every week, so the bird feeder dispenses 2 - 0.5 = <<2-0.5=1.5>>1.5 cups of birdseed every week.\nSince each cup of birdseed feeds 14 birds, Ivan\u2019s bird feeder showcases a weekly feast for 14 * 1.5 = <<14*1.5=21>>21 birds.

Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feed weekly?\n\nThe squirrel eats a half cup of birdseed every week, so Ivan refills the feeder with 2 \u2013 .5 = <<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 cups of birdseed every week.\nIf each cup feeds 14 birds, then 1.5 cups of birdseed, enough to feed 14 * 1.5 = <<14*1.5=21>>21 birds every week.

Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feed weekly?\n\nEvery week Ivan loses 1/2 cup of birdseed to the squirrel. Once a week Ivan refills the 2 cup bird feeder, so he loses 1/2 * 2 = <<1/2*2=1>>1 cup of birdseed to the squirrel.\nIvan puts in 2 cups of birdseed but loses a half so the net contribution is 2 - 1/2 = <<2-1/2=1 1/2>>1.5 cups of birdseed\nTwo cups of bird seed can feed 14 birds so 1.5 cups can feed 14*1.5 = <<14*1.5=21>>21 birds.

How big is the 6th biggest doll?\n", "text": "The nesting dolls decrease in size by 2/3 each time. To find the size of the 6th biggest doll, we can start with the biggest doll and repeatedly multiply by 2/3.\n\n243 cm x (2/3) x (2/3) x (2/3) x (2/3) x (2/3) = 243 cm x (2/3)^5 = 243 cm x (32/243) = <<243*(32/243)=32>>32 cm\n\nSo, the 6th biggest doll is 32 cm tall.

If Reese is 60 inches tall, what is the average height for the three of them?\n\nIf Reese is 60 inches tall, and Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese, Daisy's height is 60+8 = <<60+8=68>>68 inches.\nParker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, meaning he is 68-4 = <<68-4=64>>64 inches tall.\nThe total height for the three is 64+68+60 = <<64+68+60=192>>192 inches.\nThe average height for the three is 192/3 = <<192/3=64>>64 inches. Answer: \\boxed{64}.\n\n\nQuestion: Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy. Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese. If Reese is 60 inches tall, what is the average height for the three of them?\n\nDaisy is 60 + 8 = <<60+8=68>>68 inches tall.\nAnd since Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy, then Parker is 68 - 4 = <<68-4=64>>64 inches tall.\nThus, the total height for the three of them is 68 + 64 + 60 = <<68+64+60=192>>192 inches.\nThus, the average height for the three of them is 192/3 = <<192/3=64>>64 inches.
