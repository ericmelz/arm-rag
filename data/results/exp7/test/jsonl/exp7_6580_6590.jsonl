Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nLet x be the number of rubber bands Ylona had in the beginning.\nJustine had x-2 bands.\nBailey had (x-2)-10=x-12 bands.\nAfter Bailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona, he was left with x-12-2-2=x-16 bands.\nSince Bailey was left with 8 bands, then x-16=8.\nThus, Ylona had x=8+16=<<8+16=24>>24 bands in the beginning.

Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nJustine initially had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, so let's assume Bailey had x rubber bands.\nSo, Justine had x + 10 rubber bands.\nJustine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, so Ylona had x + 10 + 2 = x + 12 rubber bands.\nBailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona so he had x - 2 - 2 = x - 4 rubber bands.\nSince Bailey is left with 8 rubber bands, we have x - 4 = 8.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get x = 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nSo Ylona initially had x + 12 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 rubber bands.
