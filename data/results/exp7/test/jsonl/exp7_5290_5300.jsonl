So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed.

But Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box of crayons. If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box?\n\nIf Karen's box contained 128 crayons, and it had twice as many crayons as were in Beatrice's box, then Beatrice's box contained 128/2 = <<128/2=64>>64 crayons.\nSince Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box, then Gilbert's box contained 64/2 = <<64/2=32>>32 crayons.\nGilbert's box contained four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box, meaning Judah's box had 32/4 =<<32/4=8>>8 crayons.

In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume that there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nSince each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head, the total number of legs and heads in the flock is 3x (legs) + x (heads) = 20.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find that x, or the number of tripodasauruses in the flock, is 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5.

How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nEach tripodasaurus has one head and three legs, so in total, there are 1*x = x heads.\nAdditionally, each tripodasaurus has three legs, so the total number of legs is 3*x = 3x.\nThe problem states that the total number of heads and legs is 20, therefore we have the equation x + 3x = 20.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find x = 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nThere are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock.

How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume that there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nSince each tripodasaurus has 3 legs, the number of legs in the flock would be 3 * x = 3x.\nSince each tripodasaurus also has 1 head, the number of heads in the flock would be x.\nThe total number of heads and legs in the flock is 20 heads and legs, so x + 3x = 20.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nTherefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock.

How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume the number of tripodasauruses in the flock is x.\nSince each tripodasaurus has three legs, the total number of legs in the flock is 3x.\nSimilarly, the total number of heads in the flock is also x.\nTherefore, 3x + x = 20 (the total number of heads and legs in the flock is 20)\n4x = 20\nx = 20/4\nx = 5\nTherefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock.

If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare would need to run 20 feet in the same amount of time it takes the turtle to crawl 20 feet. \nSince the hare runs 10 feet/second, it would take 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds for the hare to run the 20 feet.\nSince the turtle crawls 1 foot/second, it would take 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds for the turtle to crawl the 20 feet.\nThus, the turtle needs a head start of 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds to finish in a tie.
