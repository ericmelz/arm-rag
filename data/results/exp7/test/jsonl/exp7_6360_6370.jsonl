If each flight of stairs has 12 steps that each each 8 inches high, how many feet further down is Jack than when he started?\n\nJack goes up 3 flights of stairs, or 3*12*8=<<3*12*8=288>>288 inches.\nThen Jack goes down 6 flights of stairs, or 6*12*8=<<6*12*8=576>>576 inches.\nTherefore, Jack ends up 576-288=<<576-288=288>>288 inches further down.\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, Jack is 288/12=<<288/12=24>>24 feet further down.

Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?\n\nIf Keaton climbed a ladder twenty times, climbing 30 feet each time, his total is 20*30 = <<20*30=600>>600 feet.\nReece, climbing a 4 feet shorter ladder fifteen times, climbs a total of 15*(30-4) = <<15*(30-4)=390>>390 feet.\nConverting Keaton's Climb to inches gives 600*12 = <<600*12=7200>>7200 inches\nSimilarly, Reece's climb in inches is 390*12 = <<390*12=4680>>4680 inches.\nTogether, Reece and Keaton climbed 4680+7200 = <<4680+7200=11880>>11880 inches. Answer: \\boxed{11880}.\n\n\nQuestion: Abe finds 4 ants on the sidewalk.  Beth sees 50% more ants than Abe.  CeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe.  Duke discovers half as many ants as Abe.  How many ants do the four children find together?\n\nBeth sees 50/100*4 ants more than Abe = <<50/100*4=2>>2 ants\nThis means Beth sees 4+2 = <<4+2=6>>6 ants\nCeCe watches twice as many ants as Abe, so CeCe sees 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 ants\nDuke discovers half as many ants as Abe, so Duke sees 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 ants\nTogether they find 4+6+8+2=<<4+6+8+2=20>>20 ants.
