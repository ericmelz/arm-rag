Each pair of pants cost the same price, and each shirt cost the same price. How much does 1 pair of pants cost?\n", "text": "Let x be the cost of 1 pair of pants. Peter bought 2 pairs of pants and 5 shirts for a total of $62, so we can write the equation 2x + 5s = $62, where s is the cost of 1 shirt. Jessica bought 2 shirts for a total of $20, so we can write the equation 2s = $20. Solving the second equation for s, we get s = $10. Substituting s = $10 into the first equation, we get 2x + 5($10) = $62. Simplifying this equation, we have 2x + $50 = $62. Subtracting $50 from both sides, we get 2x = $12. Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find x = $<<12/2=6>>6. Therefore, 1 pair of pants costs $6. Answer: \\boxed{6}."}

If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, which means it crumples 42 / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages.\nThe printer blurs the ink on every third page, which means it blurs 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages.\nHowever, some pages are both crumpled and blurred, so we need to subtract these from the total. This is because the crumpled pages are a multiple of 7, and the blurred pages are a multiple of 3, thus the multiples of the lowest common multiple are the duplicates. The printer crumples and blurs on every 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pages.\nThus, we must subtract the pages that are both crumpled and blurred, which is 42 / 21 = <<42/21=2>>2 pages.\nSo in total, he has 42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.

The total number of people at the camp is the sum of the number of boys and girls, which is x + (x + 33) = 133. \n\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 33 = 133. \n\nSubtracting 33 from both sides, we have 2x = 100.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find x = 50.\n\nTherefore, there were 50 girls at the camp.

After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?\n\nGeorgia coughs 5 times a minute and they have been coughing for 20 minutes so she has coughed 5*20 = <<5*20=100>>100 times\nRobert coughs twice as many times as Georgia or 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 coughs a minute\nRobert coughs 10 times a minute and they have been coughing for 20 minutes so he has coughed 10*20 = <<10*20=200>>200 times\nTogether, they have coughed 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300 times. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?\n\nGeorgia coughs 5 times a minute and Robert coughs twice as much so Robert coughs 2*5 = <<5*2=10>>10 times\nGeorgia coughs 5 times a minute and Robert coughs 10 times so together they cough 5+10 = <<5+10=15>>15 times\nThey coughed 15 times in 1 minute and they cough 15 times in 20 minutes so they cough 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 times. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: Georgia is sick and coughs 5 times a minute.  Her brother Robert is also sick but he coughs twice as much as her.  After 20 minutes, how many times have they coughed?\n\nGeorgia coughs 5 times a minute and Robert coughs twice as much so he coughs 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 times\nGeorgia coughs 5 times and Robert coughs 10 times for a total of 5+10 = <<5+10=15>>15 coughs per minute\nIf you cough 15 times for 20 minutes then over that time they coughed a total of 15*20 = 300 times. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: Maryann spends seven times as long doing accounting as calling clients. If she worked 560 minutes today, how many minutes did she spend calling clients?\n", "text": "If Maryann spends seven times as long doing accounting as calling clients, and she worked 560 minutes today, we can set up the equation 7x + x = 560, where x represents the time she spends calling clients. Simplifying the equation, we get 8x = 560. Dividing both sides by 8, we find x = 70. Therefore, Maryann spent 70 minutes calling clients. Answer: \\boxed{70}."}

The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes. Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations.

How many pencils are there?\n", "text": "Let's say Tommy has x pencils.\nThen Tommy has 2x pens because the pens are twice as many as the pencils.\nSo the total number of items in his pencil case is x + 2x + 1 = 13.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x + 1 = 13.\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3x = 12.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 4.\nTherefore, there are 4 pencils. Answer: \\boxed{4}."}
