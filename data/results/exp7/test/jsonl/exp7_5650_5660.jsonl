They all had a different number of marbles: Dilan had 14 marbles, Martha had 20 marbles, Phillip had 19 marbles and finally, Veronica had only 7 marbles. They wanted to redistribute the marbles so they each had an equal number. How many marbles did each friend have at the end of the day?\n", "text": "To find the number of marbles that each friend will have at the end, we find the total number of marbles and divide by the number of friends. Here, the total number of marbles is 14 + 20 + 19 + 7 = <<14+20+19+7=60>>60. Since there are 4 friends, each friend will have 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 marbles. Answer: \\boxed{15}."}

There were 50 more female adults than male adults, and children were twice the total number of adults. If there were 100 male adults, how many people attended the family reunion?\n\nThe number of female adults is 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150.\nThe total number of adults is 100 + 150 = <<100+150=250>>250.\nThe total number of children is 250 x 2 = <<250*2=500>>500.\nTherefore, 250 + 500 = <<250+500=750>>750 people attended the family reunion.

If the total number of guests were 60, and 2/3 were male guests, how many female guests attended the party?\n\nThe proportion of male guests is 2/3, which means that the proportion of female guests is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\nThere are 60 guests in total, so the number of female guests is 1/3 x 60 = <<1/3*60=20>>20. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a UFO convention, there are 120 conference attendees. If there are 4 more male attendees than female attendees, how many male attendees are there?\n\nLet M be the number of male attendees and F be the number of female attendees.\nWe know that M + F = 120 and M = F + 4.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get F + 4 + F = 120\nCombining like terms, we get 2F + 4 = 120\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2F = 116\nDividing both sides by 2, we get F = <<58=58>>58\nSubstituting this value back into M = F + 4, we get M = 58 + 4 = <<58+4=62>>62.
