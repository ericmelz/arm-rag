She placed the cakes in boxes, and then walked them out to her car.  But she had forgotten her keys.  So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Annie is a mother of 3 children: Mark, Matt, and Mike. She decided to give them some fruits. Mike received 3 oranges. Matt got twice as many apples, and Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. How many fruits do the three children have in total?\n\nIf Mike received 3 oranges, the total number of oranges is 3 oranges.\nMatt got twice as many apples, a total of 2 * 3 oranges = <<2*3=6>>6 apples.\nThe total number of fruits that Mike and Matt got is 6 apples + 3 oranges = <<6+3=9>>9 fruits.\nMark received the same number of bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether, so he got 9 fruits.\nIn total, the three children have 9 fruits + 9 fruits = <<9+9=18>>18 fruits. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Hazel and Razel are twins who share everything they receive. If Hazel received 6 shirts, while Razel received twice the number of shirts as Hazel. How many shirts do they have in total?\n\nRazel received 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 shirts.\nTherefore, they have a total of 6 + 12 = <<6+12=18>>18 shirts. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Annie is a mother of 3 children: Mark, Matt, and Mike. She decided to give them some fruits. Mike received 3 oranges. Matt got twice as many apples, and Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. How many fruits do the three children have in total?\n\nMike got 3 oranges, so in total he received 3 oranges.\nMatt got twice as many apples, which means he received 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 apples.\nSo Mike and Matt together got in total 3 + 6 = <<3+6=9>>9 fruits.\nMark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt together received fruits altogether, so he got 9 bananas.\nSo, all three children together got 3 + 6 + 9 = <<3+6+9=18>>18 fruits. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Hazel and Razel are twins who share everything they receive. If Hazel received 6 shirts, while Razel received twice the number of shirts as Hazel. How many shirts do they have in total?\n\nRazel received 2 x 6 shirts = <<2*6=12>>12 shirts.\nThus, they have a total of 6 + 12 = <<6+12=18>>18 shirts. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: During a day at the farm, Annie picked eight pints of blueberries. Kathryn picked two pints more than Annie, and Ben picked three pints fewer than Kathryn. How many pints, in total, did the three pick together?\n", "text": "Annie picked 8 pints of blueberries.\nKathryn picked 2 pints more than Annie, so she picked 8 + 2 = 10 pints.\nBen picked 3 pints fewer than Kathryn, so he picked 10 - 3 = 7 pints.\nTherefore, the three of them picked a total of 8 + 10 + 7 = <<8+10+7=25>>25 pints of blueberries together.
