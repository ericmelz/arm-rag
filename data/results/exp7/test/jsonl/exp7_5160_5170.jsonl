After fifteen minutes, the cleaner has unclogged it enough that 3 ounces can run through per minute. Ten minutes later, the clog is cleared enough for 4 ounces to run through per minute. How many ounces of cleaner were used after 30 minutes?\n\nDuring the first time interval, 15 minutes, 15*2=<<15*2=30>>30 ounces of cleaner run through.\nDuring the second time interval, the next 10 minutes, 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 ounces of cleaner run through.\nTherefore, during the first two time intervals, 30+30=<<30+30=60>>60 ounces run through.\nTherefore, during the last time interval, the remaining 30-15-10=<<30-15-10=5>>5 minutes, 5*4= <<5*4=20>>20 ounces run through.\nTherefore, in total, 60+20= <<60+20=80>>80 ounces of cleaner were used.

We know that the total number of guests is 200 and that 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 men.\nOut of the 120 men, 60% are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 men is (60/100)*120 = <<(60/100)*120=72>>72 men.\nThe total number of people wearing rabbit ears is 64 women + 72 men = <<64+72=136>>136 people.
