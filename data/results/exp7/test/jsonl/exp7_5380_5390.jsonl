How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: After trick-or-treating, Brent dumped his candy on the table.  He had received 5 Kit-Kat bars, three times that amount in Hershey kisses, 8 boxes of Nerds,  and 11 lollipops.  He also had 10 Baby Ruths and half that amount in Reese Peanut butter cups.  After giving his little sister 5 lollipops, how many pieces of candy did Brent have left?\n\nBrent received 5 Kit-Kat bars and three times that amount in Hershey kisses so he got 5*3 = <<5*3=15>>15 Hershey kisses\nHe has 11 lollipops and gave his sister 5 so 11-5 = <<11-5=6>>6 lollipops\nHe has half the amount of Reese's Peanut Butter cups as Baby Ruths so he has .5*10 = <<.5*10=5>>5 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups\nAll total he has 5 Kit-Kat bars + 15 Hershey kisses + 6 lollipops + 8 boxes of Nerds + 10 Baby Ruths + 5 Reese's Peanut Butter cups = <<5+15+6+8+10+5=49>>49 pieces of candy. Answer: \\boxed{49}.\n\n\nQuestion: Toby is in a juggling contest with a friend. The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes. Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby rotates 400 baseballs because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend rotates 404 apples because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nHis friend wins because 404 > 400.\nThe winner rotates 404 objects. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Toby is in a juggling contest with a friend. The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes.

How many friends were there?\n\nJillian has a total of 80 * 10 = <<80*10=800>>800 equal pieces of oranges.\nThus she had 800 / 4 = <<800/4=200>>200 friends. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: A small store made 50 posters to advertise their products. Two-fifths of them are small posters while half of them are medium posters. The rest are large posters. How many large posters are there?\n", "text": "There are 2/5 * 50 = <<2/5*50=20>>20 small posters.\nThere are 1/2 * 50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25 medium posters.\nSo the number of large posters is 50 - 20 - 25 = <<50-20-25=5>>5. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}
