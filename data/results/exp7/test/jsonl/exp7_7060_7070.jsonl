In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume that there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nSince each tripodasaurus has 3 legs, the number of legs in the flock would be 3 * x = 3x.\nSince each tripodasaurus also has 1 head, the number of heads in the flock would be x.\nThe total number of heads and legs in the flock is 20 heads and legs, so x + 3x = 20.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nTherefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: The tripodasaurus has three legs. In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nEach tripodasaurus has one head and three legs, so in total, there are 1*x = x heads.\nAdditionally, each tripodasaurus has three legs, so the total number of legs is 3*x = 3x.\nThe problem states that the total number of heads and legs is 20, therefore we have the equation x + 3x = 20.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find x = 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nThere are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: A bird is building a nest from twigs. The bird has put twelve twigs together already to make a circle. For each twig it placed into the circle, it wants to weave in six more twigs to fill out the nest. It knows a tree that has dropped a third of the twigs it needs. How many twigs will the bird still need to find to finish its nest?\n\nThe bird wants the circle to be 1/7 filled with twigs because 1 x 7 equals <<1/7=1/7>>1.\nIt wants to weave in six for each circle twig because 6 divided by 1 = <<6/1=6>>6.\nThe circle is built from 12 twigs because the factors of 6 with the lowest sum, 1 and 6, must also be multiplied.\nThe bird needs 72 twigs because 12 times 6 equals <<12*6=72>>72\nThe tree has dropped 24 twigs because 72 divided by 3 equals <<72/3=24>>24.\nThe bird needs to find 48 more twigs because 72 minus 24 equals <<72-24=48>>48. Answer: \\boxed{48}.\n\n\nQuestion: The tripodasaurus has three legs. In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume that there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nSince each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head, the total number of legs and heads in the flock is 3x (legs) + x (heads) = 20.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides by 4, we find that x, or the number of tripodasauruses in the flock, is 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: A snake's head is one-tenth its length. If a snake is 10 feet long, calculate the length of the rest of its body minus the head.\n\nSince the snake's head is one-tenth of its length, the head's length is 10/10 = <<10/10=1>>1 foot.\nThe length of the rest of the snake's body is 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 feet. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Four small boxes can fit in one big box. If 50 big boxes can fit four small boxes each, each having 40 candles, calculate the total number of candles in all small boxes.\n", "text": "Since one big box can fit four small boxes and each small box has 40 candles, each big box contains 4 * 40 = 160 candles.\nIf 50 big boxes can fit four small boxes each, there are a total of 50 * 160 = 8000 candles in all the big boxes.\nTherefore, there are 8000 candles in all the small boxes.
