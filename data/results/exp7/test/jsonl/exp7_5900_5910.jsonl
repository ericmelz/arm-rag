If the coconuts can be harvested every 3 months and each coconut costs $0.50, how much will he earn after 6 months?\n\nThere are 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 coconut trees.\nSo, 40 x 6 = <<40*6=240>>240 coconuts can be harvested every 3 months.\nThus, the number of coconuts that can be harvested after 6 months is 240 x 2 = <<240*2=480>>480.\nTherefore, Rohan will earn $0.50 x 480 = $<<0.50*480=240>>240.

He only had 20 chocolate oranges that he sold out. How many candy bars does Nick need to sell to reach his goal?\n\nNick made $200 because 20 times 10 equals <<20*10=200>>200\nHe has $800 left to raise because 1000 minus 200 equals <<1000-200=800>>800\nHe needs to sell 160 candy bars because 800 divided by 5 equals <<800/5=160>>160.

If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare would need to run 20 feet in the same amount of time it takes the turtle to crawl 20 feet. \nSince the hare runs 10 feet/second, it would take 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds for the hare to run the 20 feet.\nSince the turtle crawls 1 foot/second, it would take 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds for the turtle to crawl the 20 feet.\nThus, the turtle needs a head start of 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds to finish in a tie.

Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nJustine initially had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, so let's assume Bailey had x rubber bands.\nSo, Justine had x + 10 rubber bands.\nJustine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, so Ylona had x + 10 + 2 = x + 12 rubber bands.\nBailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona so he had x - 2 - 2 = x - 4 rubber bands.\nSince Bailey is left with 8 rubber bands, we have x - 4 = 8.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get x = 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nSo Ylona initially had x + 12 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 rubber bands.

Betsy can jump rope half as long as Cindy before tripping up, while Tina can jump three times as long as Betsy.  How many more minutes can Tina jump rope than Cindy?\n\nIf Cindy trips up after 12 minutes, and Betsy trips up half as often as Cindy, she can jump rope for 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 minutes.\nTina can jump rope three times as long as Betsy, meaning she can go for 3*6=<<3*6=18>>18 minutes.\nThus, Tina can jump rope 18-12=<<18-12=6>>6 more minutes than Cindy.

If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare needs to take the same amount of time as the turtle. \n\nLet's assume the turtle takes T seconds to finish the race.\n\nSince the hare runs at a speed of 10 feet/second, the hare will take 20/10 = 2 seconds to finish the race.\n\nSince the turtle crawls at a speed of 1 foot/second, the turtle will take 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds to finish the race.\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare needs to take the same amount of time as the turtle.

How many hours will it take to process all of the pictures?\n\nIt will take Alex 960 images * 2 minutes per image = <<960*2=1920>>1920 minutes.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take 1920 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<1920/60=32>>32 hours to process all of the pictures. Answer: \\boxed{32}.\n\n\nQuestion: Alex is working on a science project and has taken pictures of all of the plants in a park near her home. She wants to find out how many of each plant she has pictures of, but she has 960 pictures, and counting them all will take her a long time. Her teacher suggested she use a program on the computer that can automatically tell her what plant is in each picture and count them for her. It will take the program 2 minutes to process each picture. How many hours will it take to process all of the pictures?\n\nIf it takes the program 2 minutes to process each picture, then it will take 960 * 2 = <<960*2=1920>>1920 minutes to process all of the pictures.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, then the program will take 1920 / 60 = <<1920/60=32>>32 hours to process all of the pictures.

After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?\n\nFirst find how many feet higher Jason climbs than Matt each minute: 12 feet/minute - 6 feet/minute = <<12-6=6>>6 feet/minute\nThen multiply that number by the number of minutes to find the total difference in their heights: 6 feet/minute * 7 minutes = <<6*7=42>>42 feet. Answer: \\boxed{42}.\n\n\nQuestion: Alex is working on a science project and has taken pictures of all of the plants in a park near her home.

How many hours did he spend cleaning trees?\n", "text": "There are a total of 4 trees * 5 trees = <<4*5=20>>20 trees in the grove.\nIt takes Jack 6 minutes to clean each tree, but with help, it only takes half as long, so it takes him 6 minutes / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 minutes to clean each tree.\nTherefore, Jack spent a total of 20 trees * 3 minutes/tree = <<20*3=60>>60 minutes cleaning trees.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jack spent 60 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<60/60=1>>1 hour cleaning trees. Answer: \\boxed{1}."}
