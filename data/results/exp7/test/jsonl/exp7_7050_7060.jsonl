If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of women at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 is (40/100)*200 = <<40/100*200=80>>80.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of women wearing rabbit ears. We know that 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 is (80/100)*80 = <<80/100*80=64>>64.\nThen, we need to calculate the number of men at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200, and 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of men wearing rabbit ears. We know that 60% of the men are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 is (60/100)*120 = <<60/100*120=72>>72.\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of people wearing rabbit ears by adding the number of women wearing rabbit ears (64) and the number of men wearing rabbit ears (72), which is 64 + 72 = <<64+72=136>>136.
