If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, which means it crumples 42 / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages.\nThe printer blurs the ink on every third page, which means it blurs 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages.\nHowever, some pages are both crumpled and blurred, so we need to subtract these from the total. This is because the crumpled pages are a multiple of 7, and the blurred pages are a multiple of 3, thus the multiples of the lowest common multiple are the duplicates. The printer crumples and blurs on every 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pages.\nThus, we must subtract the pages that are both crumpled and blurred, which is 42 / 21 = <<42/21=2>>2 pages.\nSo in total, he has 42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.
