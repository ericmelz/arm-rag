If Jack is five more than twice as old as Shannen, what is the sum of the ages of all 4 people?\n\nIf Beckett is 12 and three years younger than Olaf, that means Olaf is 12+3 = <<12+3=15>>15 years old.\nShannen is two years younger than Olaf, meaning Shannen is 15-2 = <<15-2=13>>13 years old.\nTwice as old as Shannen is 2*13 = <<2*13=26>>26 years old.\nJack is five more than twice as old as Shannen, meaning Jack is 26+5 = <<26+5=31>>31 years old.\nThe sum of the ages of all four people is 12+15+13+31 = <<12+15+13+31=71>>71 years. Answer: \\boxed{71}.\n\n\nQuestion: Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy.  If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then how many pencils does Candy have?\n\nLet x be the number of pencils Caleb has.\nCalen has x+5 pencils.\nTwice the number of pencils Caleb has is 2*x.\nCaleb has 2*x-3 pencils.\n10=2*x-3\n13=2*x\nx=<<6=6>>6\nCaleb has 6 pencils.\nCandy has 2*6-3=12-3=<<2*6-3=9>>9 pencils. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Toby is in a juggling contest with a friend. The winner is whoever gets the most objects rotated around in 4 minutes. Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby makes 400 rotations because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend does 404 rotations because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nThe winner made 404 rotations because 404 > 400\nThe winner made 404 rotations because 404 > 400. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Beckett is 12 and is three years younger than Olaf, while Shannen is two years younger than Olaf.  If Jack is five more than twice as old as Shannen, what is the sum of the ages of all 4 people?\n\nBeckett is 12 and is three years younger than Olaf so Olaf is 12+3 = <<12+3=15>>15 years old\nShannen is two years younger than Olaf so she is 15-2 = <<15-2=13>>13 years old\nJack is 5 more than twice as old as Shannen, or 13*2 + 5 = <<13*2+5=31>>31 years old\nThe sum of all their ages is 12+15+13+31 = <<12+15+13+31=71>>71 years old.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations. Answer: \\boxed{404}.\n\n\nQuestion: Rick can iron 4 dress shirts in an hour.  He can iron 3 dress pants in an hour.  If he spends 3 hours ironing dress shirts and 5 hours ironing dress pants, how many pieces of clothing has he ironed?\n", "text": "In 3 hours, Rick can iron 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 dress shirts.\nIn 5 hours, Rick can iron 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 dress pants.\nTherefore, Rick has ironed a total of 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27 pieces of clothing. Answer: \\boxed{27}."}
