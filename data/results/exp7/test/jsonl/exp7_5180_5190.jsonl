If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nSince Coraline's number is 80, Jayden's number is 80-40 = <<80-40=40>>40\nIf Mickey's number is 20 more than Jayden's number, his number is 40+20 = <<20+40=60>>60\nThe total of the numbers the three have is 80+40+60 = <<80+40+60=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20.

Jen ran third and finished in 30 seconds.  Tiffany ran the last leg and finished in 7 seconds less than Mary.  How many seconds did it take the team to finish the race?\n", "text": "If Jen finished the race in 30 seconds, then Susan took 30+10 = <<30+10=40>>40 seconds.\nIf Mary took twice as long as Susan, then Mary took 40*2 = <<40*2=80>>80 seconds.\nTiffany finished the last leg in 80-7 = <<80-7=73>>73 seconds.\nThe total time taken by the team to finish the race is 30+40+80+73 = <<30+40+80+73=223>>223 seconds. Answer: \\boxed{223}."}
