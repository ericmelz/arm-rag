After a week, he's doubled the amount of time he can do it.  After another week, he's doubled it again from the previous week.  The final week, he's increased it by 50% from the previous week.  How long can Brian hold his breath for now?\n\nIn the first week, Brian doubles his time, so he can hold it for 10*2 = <<10*2=20>>20 seconds.\nIn the second week, he doubles his time again, so he can hold it for 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40 seconds.\nIn the final week, he increases his time by 50%, so he can hold it for 40*.5 = <<40*.5=20>>20 seconds more.\nSo in total, he can hold it for 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 seconds.

How long can Brian hold his breath for now?\n\nAfter the first week, Brian can hold his breath for 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 seconds underwater\nAfter the second week, he's doubled that, meaning he can now hold his breath for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds underwater\nIn his third week, he increases that by 50%, meaning he adds .50*40=<<50*.01*40=20>>20 more seconds\nAdding that increase means Brian can hold his breath for 40+20= <<40+20=60>>60 seconds underwater.

How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe remainder is 12-4 = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges.\nOne-fourth of 8 is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: It takes 1 person working 10 hours to figure out the solution to a math problem.  If you add a second person who's equally good at math, how long will the two of them have to work to solve the same problem?\n", "text": "If one person can solve the problem in 10 hours, then they can do 1/10 of the work in 1 hour. \nIf the second person is equally good, then they can also do 1/10 of the work in 1 hour.\nTogether, they can do 1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10 = 1/5 of the work in 1 hour.\nSo it will take them 1/(1/5) = 5 hours to solve the problem together. \nAnswer: \\boxed{5}."}
