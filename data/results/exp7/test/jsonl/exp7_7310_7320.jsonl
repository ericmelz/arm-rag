The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?\n\nFirst find the proportion of the eggs that are blue: 4/5 * 100% = 80%\nThen find the proportion of the eggs that are purple: 1/5 * 100% = 20%\nThen find the proportion of the purple eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are purple: 1/2 * 1/5 = 1/10\nThen find the proportion of the blue eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are blue: 1/4 * 4/5 = 1/5\nThen add the proportion of purple eggs with 5 pieces of candy to the proportion of blue eggs with 5 pieces of candy to find the overall proportion with 5 pieces: 1/10 + 1/5 = 1/10 + 2/10 = 3/10\nThen multiply the proportion of eggs with 5 pieces by 100% to find the percentage chance of getting a blue egg with 5 pieces: 3/10 * 100% = 30%.

How much time will they save if they drive 60 miles an hour instead of 50 miles an hour?\n\nTo find the time saved, we need to find the difference in time it takes to travel 1200 miles at 60 mph and 50 mph.\nAt 60 mph, it will take them 1200/60 = <<1200/60=20>>20 hours.\nAt 50 mph, it will take them 1200/50 = <<1200/50=24>>24 hours.\nTherefore, they will save 24 - 20 = <<24-20=4>>4 hours.

Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bob runs 6 miles per hour. His friend Jim runs at 9 miles per hour. If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?\n\nBob has a head-start of 1 mile, which means he is 1 mile ahead of Jim when they start running.\nThe difference in their speeds is 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 miles per hour.\nSo, it will take Jim 1 / 3 = <<1/3=0.3333333333333333>>0.33333 hours to catch up to Bob.\nTherefore, it will take Jim 0.33333 x 60 = <<0.33333*60=19.9998>>19.9998 minutes to catch up to Bob.\nHence, it will take Jim approximately 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

How much time will they save if they drive 60 miles an hour instead of 50 miles an hour?\n\nTo find the time difference, we need to find the time it takes to drive 1200 miles at each speed. \n\nAt 60 miles per hour, it will take Melinda 1200 miles / 60 miles per hour = 20 hours.\n\nAt 50 miles per hour, it will take Melinda 1200 miles / 50 miles per hour = 24 hours.\n\nThe time difference is 24 hours - 20 hours = <<24-20=4>>4 hours.

How many miles farther can the superhero run in an hour than the supervillain can drive?\n", "text": "In one hour, the superhero can run 60 minutes / 4 minutes per 10 miles = 15 sets of 10 miles.\nSo the superhero can run 15 sets of 10 miles = 15 * 10 miles = 150 miles in an hour.\nThe supervillain can drive 100 miles per hour.\nTherefore, the superhero can run 150 miles - 100 miles = <<150-100=50>>50 miles farther than the supervillain can drive in an hour.

The first and second months\u2019 issues were the same number of pages, but the third month\u2019s issue was four pages longer than either of the others. How many pages was the first issue of the comic?\n", "text": "Let's assume the number of pages in the first and second months' issues is x.\nThe third month's issue is four pages longer, so it would be x + 4.\nIn three months, Trevor has drawn 220 pages, so the total number of pages in the comic is x + x + (x + 4) = 220.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x + 4 = 220.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3x = 216.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 72.\nTherefore, the first issue of the comic had 72 pages.

Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Phillip wants to make pickles with the supplies he finds at home. He has 4 jars, 10 cucumbers, and 100 oz of vinegar. Each cucumber makes six pickles. Each jar can hold 12 pickles. It takes 10 ounces of vinegar per jar of pickles. When he is all done making as many pickles as he has supplies for, how many ounces of vinegar are left?\n", "text": "Each cucumber makes 6 pickles, so he can make a total of 10 cucumbers * 6 pickles per cucumber = 60 pickles.\nEach jar can hold 12 pickles, so he can fill a total of 4 jars * 12 pickles per jar = 48 pickles.\nTherefore, Phillip can only make 48 pickles because that is the maximum number of pickles that will fit in his jars.\nIt takes 10 ounces of vinegar per jar of pickles, so he will need a total of 4 jars * 10 ounces of vinegar per jar = 40 ounces of vinegar for all the pickles.\nHe started with 100 ounces of vinegar and he needs 40 ounces, so he will have 100 ounces - 40 ounces = 60 ounces of vinegar left. Answer: \\boxed{60}."}
