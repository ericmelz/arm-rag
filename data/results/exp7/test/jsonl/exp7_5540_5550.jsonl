How many parsnips does Betty grow in an average harvest?\n", "text": "Betty gets an average of 20 boxes each harvest. If three-quarters of the boxes are full and the remaining boxes are half full, the number of full boxes is 20 * 0.75 = 15.\nSince each box can hold up to 20 parsnips, the number of parsnips in the full boxes is 15 * 20 = 300.\nThe remaining boxes are half full, so the number of remaining boxes is 20 - 15 = 5.\nIf each remaining box is half full, the number of parsnips in the remaining boxes is 5 * (20 / 2) = 50.\nTherefore, Betty grows a total of 300 + 50 = <<300+50=350>>350 parsnips in an average harvest.

He buys 6 2$ cans of soup, 2 $5 loaves of bread, 2 3$ boxes of cereal, and 2 $4 gallons of milk.  When he gets to the register, he opens his wallet to pay and realizes he only has $10 bills in there.  How many $10 bills does he need to use to pay?\n\nThe soup cost 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 dollars.\nThe bread cost 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 dollars.\nThe cereal cost 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 dollars.\nThe milk cost 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 dollars.\nAll total, he spent 12+10+6+8=<<12+10+6+8=36>>36 dollars.\nTo pay for his purchase entirely in $10 bills, he needs 36/10=<<36/10=3.6>>3.6 $10 bills, meaning he needs exactly 4 $10 bills to pay for his purchase.

He bought a gallon of milk for $3, two boxes of cereal for $3.5 each, 4 bananas for $.25 each, four apples that cost $.5 each and a number of boxes of cookies. The cookies cost twice as much per box as the gallon of milk. How many boxes of cookies did he get?\n\nThe cereal cost 3.5 * 2 = $<<3.5*2=7>>7.\nThe bananas cost .25 * 4 = $<<.25*4=1>>1.\nThe apples cost .5 * 4 = $<<.5*4=2>>2.\nThis leaves Steve 25 - 3 - 7 - 1 - 2 = $<<25-3-7-1-2=12>>12.\nEach box of cookies cost 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6\nSteve was able to buy 12 / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2 boxes of cookies.

When he gets to the register, he opens his wallet to pay and realizes he only has $10 bills in there.  How many $10 bills does he need to use to pay?\n\nThe 6 cans of soup are $2 each so they cost 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00\nThe 2 loafs of bread are $5 each so they cost 2*5 = $<<2*5=10.00>>10.00\nThe 2 boxes of cereal are $3 each so they cost 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00\nThe 2 gallons of milk are $4 each so they cost 2*4 = $<<2*4=8.00>>8.00\nAll total his bill is 12+10+6+8 = $<<12+10+6+8=36.00>>36.00\nHe only has $10 bills so he needs 36/10 = <<36/10=3.60>>3.60 or he needs 4 ten dollar bills.

If candies cost 20 cents apiece and Jake's feeding allowance is $4, how many candies can his friend purchase with the money Jake gave to him?\n\nJake gave to his friend 1/4*$4 = $<<1/4*4=1>>1.\nTherefore Jake's friend can purchase $1/$0.20 = <<1/0.20=5>>5 candies. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Steve bought $25 worth of groceries. He bought a gallon of milk for $3, two boxes of cereal for $3.5 each, 4 bananas for $.25 each, four apples that cost $.5 each and a number of boxes of cookies. The cookies cost twice as much per box as the gallon of milk. How many boxes of cookies did he get?\n\nThe two boxes of cereal cost $3.5x2 = $<<3.5*2=7>>7.\nThe bananas cost $0.25x4 = $<<0.25*4=1>>1.\nAnd four apples cost $0.5x4 = $<<0.5*4=2>>2.\nSo far, Steve spent $7+$1+$2+$3 = $<<7+1+2+3=13>>13.\nThe cookies cost cost $3x2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.\nSteve has $25-$13=$<<25-13=12>>12 left to spend on cookies.\nThe number of boxes of cookies he could buy is $12/$6 = <<12/6=2>>2.
