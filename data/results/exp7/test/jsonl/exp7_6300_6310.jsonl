While she is waiting for school to start on Monday she counts the tiles on the ceiling--38. While she is waiting for everyone to finish their tests after she has handed in hers, she counts the books in the room--75. On Tuesday Carla counts all the tiles twice in a row and she counts the books three times in a row when she has to wait for a long time for the teacher to finish handing out the graded tests. If every time Carla counts something counts as once, how many times has Carla counted something on Tuesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, Carla counts the tiles twice in a row, and the books three times in a row. So, she has counted the tiles 2 * 38 = <<2*38=76>>76 times.\nAnd she has counted the books 3 * 75 = <<3*75=225>>225 times.\nIn total, Carla has counted something 76 + 225 = <<76+225=301>>301 times on Tuesday.
