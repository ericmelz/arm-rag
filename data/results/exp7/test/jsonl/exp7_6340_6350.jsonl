He can tell a lot about an animal by the footprints it leaves behind.  One day he saw a set of coyote footprints.  Based on the impressions, he could tell the animal was traveling east at 15 miles per hour, and that the animal left the prints 1 hour ago.  If the coyote continues to travel east at 15 miles per hour, and Darrell hops on his motorbike and travels east at 30 miles per hour, how long, in hours, will it take for Darrel to catch up to the coyote?\n\nThe coyote has been traveling east for 15 miles per hour for 1 hour, so it has traveled 15*1 = <<15*1=15>>15 miles.\nDarrell is traveling east at 30 miles per hour, so he will catch up to the coyote at a rate of 30-15 = <<30-15=15>>15 miles per hour.\nTo travel 15 miles at a rate of 15 miles per hour, it will take Darrell 15/15 = <<15/15=1>>1 hour.

If his daily goal is 10,000 steps, how many minutes will it take him to reach his goal?\n\nHe walks 2000 steps in 30 minutes and his goal is 10,000 steps. This means he walks 10000/2000 = <<10000/2000=5>>5 times his goal\nIt takes him 30 minutes to reach 2000 steps and he does this 5 times so it will take him 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{150}.\n\n\nQuestion: Keanu was surfing towards the shore at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  A shark was swimming alongside him, riding the same wave, when it doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu.  There was a pilot fish swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, and when the shark increased its speed, the pilot fish also increased its speed and moved away from Keanu, but only increasing its speed by half as much as the shark had increased its speed by.  What speed, in miles per hour, was the pilot fish swimming when it moved away from Keanu?\n\nIf the shark doubled its speed, then it was swimming at 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles per hour.\nIf the shark increased its speed by 40-20=<<40-20=20>>20 miles per hour.\nIf the pilot fish increased its speed by half as much, then it added 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 miles per hour to its original speed.\nThus, the pilot fish was swimming 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30 miles per hour when it moved away from Keanu. Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: Nellie can eat 12 sourball candies before crying. Jacob can only manage half of that number of candies, and Lana can only do three fewer than Jacob. They had a bucket of 30 candies, and all of them ate until they cried. If they divide the remaining candies in the bucket equally, how many sourball candies will they each get?\n\nJacob can eat 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 sourball candies before crying.\nLana can eat 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 sourball candies before crying.\nThe three of them could eat 12 + 6 + 3 = <<12+6+3=21>>21 sourball candies before crying.\nSo in the bucket, there were 30 - 21 = <<30-21=9>>9 candy remaining.\nTherefore, they will each get 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 sourball candies. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute. The brown rabbit hops 12 meters per minute. What is the total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes?\n\nIn one minute, the white rabbit can hop 15 meters and the brown rabbit can hop 12 meters. So in 5 minutes, the white rabbit will cover 15 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 75 meters.\nSimilarly, the brown rabbit will cover 12 meters/minute x 5 minutes = 60 meters.\nThe total distance the two rabbits will hop in 5 minutes is 75 meters + 60 meters = <<75+60=135>>135 meters. Answer: \\boxed{135}.\n\n\nQuestion: A cargo ship moving from Shanghai to Vancouver navigates for 21 days before reaching port. Customs and regulatory processes in Vancouver last 4 days. Finally, moving the cargo from the port to your rural warehouse takes some time and it always arrives on the seventh day. How many days ago should the ship have departed if your warehouse is expecting the shipment 2 days from today?\n", "text": "The cargo ship takes 21 days to travel from Shanghai to Vancouver. After reaching Vancouver, customs and regulatory processes take an additional 4 days. Finally, it takes 7 days to move the cargo from the port to the rural warehouse. So in total, from the time the ship departs until the cargo arrives at the warehouse, it will take 21 + 4 + 7 = 32 days.\nIf the warehouse is expecting the shipment 2 days from today, then the ship should have departed 32 - 2 = 30 days ago.

While she is waiting for school to start on Monday she counts the tiles on the ceiling--38. While she is waiting for everyone to finish their tests after she has handed in hers, she counts the books in the room--75. On Tuesday Carla counts all the tiles twice in a row and she counts the books three times in a row when she has to wait for a long time for the teacher to finish handing out the graded tests. If every time Carla counts something counts as once, how many times has Carla counted something on Tuesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, Carla counts the tiles twice in a row, and the books three times in a row. So, she has counted the tiles 2 * 38 = <<2*38=76>>76 times.\nAnd she has counted the books 3 * 75 = <<3*75=225>>225 times.\nIn total, Carla has counted something 76 + 225 = <<76+225=301>>301 times on Tuesday. Answer: \\boxed{301}.\n\n\nQuestion: Isabella has three times as many green houses as yellow houses. She also has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses. If she has 90 green houses, how many of her houses are not yellow?\n", "text": "If Isabella has 90 green houses, then she has 90/3 = <<90/3=30>>30 yellow houses.\nShe has 40 fewer yellow houses than red houses, so she has 30 + 40 = <<30+40=70>>70 red houses.\nSince Isabella has 90 green houses and 70 red houses, the total number of her houses is 90 + 30 + 70 = <<90+30+70=190>>190.\nTherefore, Isabella has 190 - 30 = <<190-30=160>>160 houses that are not yellow. Answer: \\boxed{160}."}
