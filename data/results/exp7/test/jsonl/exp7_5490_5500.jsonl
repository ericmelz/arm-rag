The swimming pool is empty and the garage is locked, so he cannot use the hose to fill the pool. He finds a 2 gallon bucket and calculates that it takes 20 seconds to fill the bucket from the tap and carry it to the pool where he pours in the water. If the pool holds 84 gallons of water, how many minutes will it take Jimmy to fill the pool?\n", "text": "Jimmy fills the 2 gallon bucket in 20 seconds. So he needs 84 gallons / 2 gallons per bucket = 42 buckets.\nEach bucket takes him 20 seconds to fill, so 42 buckets * 20 seconds per bucket = 840 seconds.\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, Jimmy will take 840 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 14 minutes to fill the pool. Answer: \\boxed{14}."}

How much farther, in miles, does Grayson go in his motorboat compared to Rudy?\n", "text": "Grayson travels 1 hour at 25 mph, so he covers 1 * 25 = <<1*25=25>>25 miles.\nGrayson also travels 0.5 hour at 20 mph, so he covers 0.5 * 20 = <<0.5*20=10>>10 miles.\nIn total, Grayson covers 25 + 10 = <<25+10=35>>35 miles.\nRudy travels for 3 hours at 10 mph, so he covers 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 miles.\nTherefore, Grayson goes 35 - 30 = <<35-30=5>>5 miles farther than Rudy. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}
