How long would it take him to type out 10 pages?\n", "text": "If Tom can type 90 words a minute, he can type 90 * 10 = <<90*10=900>>900 words in 10 minutes\nSince a page is 450 words, 10 pages would be 10 * 450 = <<10*450=4500>>4500 words.\nTherefore, it would take Tom 4500 / 90 = <<4500/90=50>>50 minutes to type out 10 pages. Answer: \\boxed{50}."}

If he counted 312 cars total, how many of them were purple?\n\nLet p be the number of purple cars\nThe number of red cars is p+6\nAnd the number of green cars is 4(p+6)=4p+24\nThere are p+(p+6)+(4p+24)=312 cars total.\nCombining like terms, we get 6p+30=312\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 6p=282\nDividing both sides by 6, we get p=<<47=47>>47 purple cars.

How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe remainder is 12-4 = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges.\nOne-fourth of 8 is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?\n\nOne-third of 12 oranges is (1/3)*12 = <<(1/3)*12=4>>4 oranges.\nThe first boy remains with 12 oranges - 4 oranges = <<12-4=8>>8 oranges after giving out some to his brother.\nOne-fourth of 8 oranges is (1/4)*8 = <<(1/4)*8=2>>2 oranges. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 516 cars in a parking lot. One-third are blue, one-half are red, and the rest are black. How many black cars are on the lot?\n\nOne-third of the cars are blue, so there are 516 * 1/3 = <<516*1/3=172>>172 blue cars.\nOne-half of the cars are red, so there are 516 * 1/2 = <<516*1/2=258>>258 red cars.\nThat leaves 516 - 172 - 258 = <<516-172-258=86>>86 cars that are black. Answer: \\boxed{86}.\n\n\nQuestion: A particular train has some passenger cars and a number of cargo cars equal to half the number of passenger cars plus three. If the total number of cars is 71, counting the engine and caboose, how many passenger cars are in the train?\n", "text": "Let p be the number of passenger cars.\nThe number of cargo cars is (1/2)*p + 3.\nThe total number of cars is p + (1/2)*p + 3 + 2 = 71, since we also have to count the engine and caboose.\nCombining like terms, we get (3/2)*p + 5 = 71.\nSubtracting 5 from both sides, we get (3/2)*p = 66.\nMultiplying both sides by 2/3, we get p = 44.\nTherefore, the train has <<44=44>>44 passenger cars.

Her oldest wants 2 string cheeses every day, and her youngest wants 1 string cheese. This means Kelly needs a total of (2 + 1) string cheeses per day for her kids.\nIn 1 week, there are 5 days, so Kelly needs (2 + 1) * 5 = 15 string cheeses per week for her kids.\nFor 4 weeks, Kelly will need 15 * 4 = 60 string cheeses for her kids' lunches.\nEach pack of string cheese has 30 string cheeses, so Kelly will need 60 / 30 = <<60/30=2>>2 packs of string cheese. \nAnswer: \\boxed{2}."}
