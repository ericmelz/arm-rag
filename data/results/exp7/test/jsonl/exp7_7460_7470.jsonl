Of the men, 75% have a college degree and 8 do not. How many women work at Sarah's company?\n\nLet x be the number of male employees at the company.\nThen the number of men without a degree is 8 and the number of men with a degree is x - 8.\nSo, the total number of men is 8 + x - 8 = x.\nAnd the percentage of men at the company is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.\nSo, the total number of employees at the company is x / 0.4 = 2.5x.\nThe number of male employees with a degree is 0.75x.\nThen we know that 2.5x - x - 0.75x = 8.\nSo, 1.75x = 8.\nAnd the number of male employees is x = 8 / 1.75 = 32.\nTherefore, the total number of employees at Sarah's company is 32 / 0.4 = <<32/0.4=80>>80.\nThus, the number of women at Sarah's job is 0.6 * 80 = <<0.6*80=48>>48.

How many pages will she read tomorrow?\n\nMelody will read 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pages of English tomorrow.\nShe will read 16/4 = <<16/4=4>>4 pages of Science tomorrow.\nShe will read 8/4 = <<8/4=2>>2 pages of Civics tomorrow.\nShe will read 12/4 = <<12/4=3>>3 pages of Chinese tomorrow.\nTherefore, Melody will read a total of 5+4+2+3 = <<5+4+2+3=14>>14 pages tomorrow. Answer: \\boxed{14}.\n\n\nQuestion: Abigail spent 60% of her money on food, and 25% of the remainder on her phone bill. After spending $20 on entertainment, she is left with $40. How much money did Abigail have initially?\n\nLet X be the initial amount of money Abigail had.\nSince Abigail spent 60% of her money on food, she has 40% of X remaining.\nAbigail has 40/100 * X = 2/5 * X remaining.\nShe spent 25% of that remaining money on her phone bill, meaning she has 75% remaining.\nAbigail has 75/100 * (2/5 * X) = (3/4) * (2/5 * X) remaining.\nAfter spending $20 on entertainment, Abigail has (3/4) * (2/5 * X) - $20 = $40 remaining.\nThus, (3/4) * (2/5 * X) = $40 + $20.\nThus, (3/4) * (2/5 * X) = $60.\nThus, (2/5 * X) = $60 / (3/4) = 60/ (3/4) = 60 / (3/4) = 60 / (3/4) = $80.\nThus, X = $80 / (2/5) = $80 * (5/2) = $200.\nTherefore, Abigail had $200 initially. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: Melody needs to read 20 pages for her English class, 16 pages for her Science class, 8 pages for her Civics, and 12 pages for Chinese class.

If each stanza has 10 lines, and each line has 8 words, calculate the total number of words in the poem.\n\nIf one stanza contains 10 lines with 8 words each, the total number of words in one stanza is 10*8=<<10*8=80>>80 words.\nSalem created a poem with 20 stanzas, meaning the number of words in the poem is 20*80=<<20*80=1600>>1600 words. Answer: \\boxed{1600}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jerry wakes up one morning and finds the thermostat set to 40 degrees. He set it to double the initial temperature. His dad notices, yells at Jerry, and reducing the temperature by 30 degrees. Later, Jerry's mother reduces the temperature by 30%, before his sister increases it by 24 degrees. What's the final temperature?\n\nJerry sets the thermostat to double the initial temperature, which means 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 degrees.\nHis dad reduces the temperature by 30 degrees, so 80 - 30 = <<80-30=50>>50 degrees.\nHis mother reduces the temperature by 30%, which means 50 - 0.3 * 50 = <<50-0.3*50=35>>35 degrees.\nHis sister increases the temperature by 24 degrees, which means 35 + 24 = <<35+24=59>>59 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{59}.\n\n\nQuestion: Very early this morning, Elise left home in a cab headed for the hospital. Fortunately, the roads were clear, and the cab company only charged her a base price of $3, and $4 for every mile she traveled. If Elise paid a total of $23, how far is the hospital from her house?\n", "text": "Let X be the number of miles Elise traveled.\nSince the cab company charges $4 for every mile, the total cost of travel is $4*X.\nSince the cab company also charges a base price of $3, the total cost of travel is $4*X + $3.\nIf Elise paid a total of $23, then $4*X + $3 = $23.\nTo find X, we must solve the equation $4*X + $3 = $23.\nSubtracting $3 from both sides, we get $4*X = $23 - $3 = $20.\nDividing both sides by $4, we find X = $20 / $4 = 5 miles.\nTherefore, the hospital is 5 miles away from Elise's house. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}
