In the afternoon, she was able to sell 50 apples and 40 oranges. How much are her total sales for the day?\n\nIn the morning, her total sales for apple is $1.50 x 40 = $<<1.5*40=60>>60.\nIn the morning, her total sales for orange is $1 x 30 = $<<1*30=30>>30.\nSo, her total sales in the morning is $60 + $30 = $<<60+30=90>>90.\nIn the afternoon, her total sales for apple is $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.\nIn the afternoon, her total sales for orange is $1 x 40 = $<<1*40=40>>40.\nSo, her total sales in the afternoon is $75 + $40 = $<<75+40=115>>115.\nTherefore, her total sales for the day is $90 + $115 = $<<90+115=205>>205.

However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.\n\nLilith originally had 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 water bottles.\nAt $1.85 per water bottle, she will earn 60 x $1.85 = $<<60*1.85=111>>111 when she sells all the water bottles.\nLilith will have to find $111 - $120 = $<<111-120=-9>>9 to buy her friend the birthday gift.

If Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, how many did Matthew eat?\n\nIf Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, since Patrick ate half as many egg rolls as Alvin ate, Patrick ate 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 egg rolls.\nThe total number of egg rolls that Patrick and Alvin ate is 2+4 = <<2+4=6>>6 egg rolls.\nMatthew ate three times as many egg rolls as Patrick ate, meaning he ate 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 egg rolls. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bill is hoarding toilet paper in fear of another pandemic. Bill goes to the bathroom three times a day and uses 5 squares of toilet paper each time. If Bill has 1000 rolls of toilet paper and each roll has 300 squares of toilet paper, how many days will his toilet paper supply last?\n", "text": "Bill uses 5 squares of toilet paper per bathroom visit, and he goes to the bathroom 3 times a day. So, he uses a total of 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 squares of toilet paper each day.\nEach roll of toilet paper has 300 squares, so each day, Bill uses 15 / 300 = <<15/300=0.05>>0.05 rolls of toilet paper.\nBill has 1000 rolls of toilet paper in total, so his supply will last 1000 / 0.05 = <<1000/0.05=20000>>20,000 days. Answer: \\boxed{20,000}."}
