If there are 72 business in town, how many businesses can he still apply to?\n\nBrandon has been fired from half the businesses, which is 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>36 businesses.\nHe has quit from a third of the businesses, which is 72/3 = <<72/3=24>>24 businesses.\nThus, he has been fired from or quit from a total of 36+24 = <<36+24=60>>60 businesses.\nTherefore, he can still apply to 72-60 = <<72-60=12>>12 businesses. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: If 8 carpenters can make 50 chairs in 10 days, how many carpenters are needed to make 75 chairs in 10 days?\n", "text": "If 8 carpenters can make 50 chairs in 10 days, then we can set up a proportion to find out how many carpenters are needed to make 75 chairs in 10 days.\n\nThe proportion can be set up as:\n\n8 carpenters / 50 chairs = x carpenters / 75 chairs\n\nwhere x represents the number of carpenters needed to make 75 chairs.\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n8 * 75 = 50 * x\n\n600 = 50x\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 50, we get:\n\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 carpenters are needed to make 75 chairs in 10 days. Answer: \\boxed{12}."}
