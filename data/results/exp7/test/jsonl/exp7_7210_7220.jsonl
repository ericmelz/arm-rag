Paul bought 4 dress shirts at $15.00 apiece, 2 pairs of pants that each cost $40.00.  He found a suit for $150.00 and 2 sweaters for $30.00 each.  When he got to the register, the clerk told him that the store was offering 20% off of everything in the store.  After the discounts and the coupon, how much did Paul spend on his new clothes?\n", "text": "Paul bought 4 dress shirts at $15.00 apiece, which totals $15.00 x 4 = $<<15*4=60.00>>60.00.\nHe bought 2 pairs of pants, which totaled $40.00 x 2 = $<<40*2=80.00>>80.00.\nHe bought 2 sweaters, which totaled $30.00 x 2 = $<<30*2=60.00>>60.00.\nThe suit cost $150.00.\nThe total cost of the clothes before any discounts is $60.00 + $80.00 + $60.00 + $150.00 = $<<60+80+60+150=350.00>>350.00.\nThe store is offering 20% off, so the discount is $350.00 x 20/100 = $<<350*20/100=70.00>>70.00.\nAfter the 20% discount, the total cost is $350.00 - $70.00 = $<<350-70=280.00>>280.00.\nPaul has a 10% off coupon, so he can apply another discount of $280.00 x 10/100 = $<<280*10/100=28.00>>28.00.\nThe final cost after all the discounts is $280.00 - $28.00 = $<<280-28=252.00>>252.00. Answer: \\boxed{252}."}
