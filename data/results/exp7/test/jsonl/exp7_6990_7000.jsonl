She placed the cakes in boxes, and then walked them out to her car.  But she had forgotten her keys.  So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed.
