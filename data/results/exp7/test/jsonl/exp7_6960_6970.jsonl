And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nPolly stands for three times as long as Pulsar, for 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nPetra stands for one-sixth as long as Polly, which is 30/6=<<30/6=5>>5 minutes.\nThus, the total time for all three entertainers is 10+30+5=<<10+30+5=45>>45 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{45}.\n\n\nQuestion: A class has 32 students and they all need to present their projects. Every period is 40 minutes long. How many periods will it take for every student to present their project if they have 5 minutes to do so?\n", "text": "Each student will need 5 minutes to present their project and there are 32 students. To find the total time required, we multiply 5 minutes by 32 students: 5 * 32 = 160 minutes. Since each period is 40 minutes long, we divide the total time required (160 minutes) by the length of each period (40 minutes) to find the number of periods needed: 160 / 40 = 4 periods. Answer: \\boxed{4}."}
