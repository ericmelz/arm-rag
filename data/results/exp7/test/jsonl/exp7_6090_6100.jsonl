If he spent 2 hours and 10 minutes at the zoo, how many minutes did he spent looking at the seals?\n", "text": "Let's call the amount of time Walter spent looking at the seals S minutes. We know that he spent eight times as long looking at the penguins, so he spent 8S minutes looking at the penguins. Adding the time spent looking at the seals and penguins, we have S + 8S = 9S total minutes spent. We also know that Walter spent 13 minutes looking at the elephants. Finally, we know that Walter spent a total of 2 hours and 10 minutes at the zoo, which is equal to 2 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour + 10 minutes = 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes. \n\nSetting up an equation using the information we have, we can solve for S:\n9S + 13 = 130\nSubtracting 13 from both sides:\n9S = 117\nDividing both sides by 9:\nS =<<13=13>>13\n\nTherefore, Walter spent 13 minutes looking at the seals.
