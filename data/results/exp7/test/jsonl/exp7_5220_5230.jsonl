She needs 2 cups of flour, a cup of white sugar, a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and a 1/2 cup of oil. Her only measuring scoop is 1/4 cup. How many times does she fill it to complete the measurements?\n\nTo measure 2 cups of flour, Felicia fills the scoop 8 times because 2 / (1/4) = 8\nShe fills the scoop 4 times with white sugar because 1 / (1/4) = <<1/(1/4)=4>>4\nShe fills the cup 2 times with oil because (1/2) / (1/4) = <<(1/2)/(1/4)=2>>2\nShe fills the scoop 1 time with brown sugar because (1/4) / (1/4) = 1\nOverall, she fills the scoop 15 times because 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = <<8+4+2+1=15>>15.

If he initially had 80 white cookies, how many cookies are remaining within the cookie jar altogether?\n\nIf Cristian had 80 white cookies and eats 3/4 of them, he ate 3/4*80 = <<3/4*80=60>>60 white cookies.\nCristian remains with 80-60 = <<80-60=20>>20 white cookies.\nCristian also had 50 more black cookies in the jar initially than white cookies, a total of 80+50 = <<50+80=130>>130 black cookies.\nWhen he eats half of the black cookies, the number of black cookies reduces to 1/2*130 = <<1/2*130=65>>65 black cookies.\nThe total number of cookies remaining in the jar altogether is 65+20 = <<65+20=85>>85. Answer: \\boxed{85}.\n\n\nQuestion: Frank has three less than half the number of cookies as Mike. Mike has three times as many cookies as Millie. If Millie has 4 cookies, how many cookies does Frank have?\n\nFirst triple the number of cookies that Millie has, performing 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12.\nThen divide this number in half, performing 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6.\nThus, Frank has 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cookies.

If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nIf Coraline's number is 80, Jayden's number is 80-40 = <<80-40=40>>40\nMickey's number is 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 which is 20 greater than Jayden's number.\nJayden's number is 60-20 = <<60-20=40>>40\nTogether, the three have 60+40+80 = <<60+40+80=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Colbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?\n\nColbert needs 200 wooden planks for the treehouse.\nFrom his storage, he gets 1/4 * 200 = <<1/4*200=50>>50 planks.\nFrom his parents, he gets 1/2 * 200 = <<1/2*200=100>>100 planks.\nWith his friends' help, he gets 20 planks.\nFrom storage and his parents and with friends, he has 50 + 100 + 20 = <<50+100+20=170>>170 planks.\nHe needs to buy 200 - 170 = <<200-170=30>>30 planks from the store.

Considering there are no other guests, in how many different rooms could Hans be checked in?\n\nThere are a total of 10 floors with 10 rooms each, totaling 10 * 10 = <<10*10=100>>100 rooms.\n\nHowever, the last floor is unavailable, so Hans cannot be checked into any room on that floor.\n\nTherefore, Hans could be checked into 100 - 10 = <<100-10=90>>90 different rooms. Answer: \\boxed{90}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 42 apples in a crate. 12 crates of apples were delivered to a factory. 4 apples were rotten and had to be thrown away. The remaining apples were packed into boxes that could fit 10 apples each. How many boxes of apples were there?\n", "text": "There are 12 crates of apples delivered to the factory, and each crate contains 42 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples is 12 * 42 = 504 apples.\nOut of the 504 apples, 4 were rotten and had to be thrown away, leaving 504 - 4 = 500 remaining apples.\nEach box can fit 10 apples, so the number of boxes needed is 500 / 10 = 50 boxes.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby rotates 400 baseballs because 5 x 80 = <<5*80=400>>400\nHis friend rotates 404 apples because 4 x 101 = <<4*101=404>>404\nHis friend wins because 404 > 400.\nThe winner rotates 404 objects.

Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Matthew, Patrick and Alvin are eating dinner together. Matthew eats three times as many egg rolls as Patrick eats. Patrick eats half as many egg rolls as Alvin eats. If Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, how many did Matthew eat?\n\nIf Alvin ate 4 egg rolls, since Patrick ate half as many egg rolls as Alvin ate, Patrick ate 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 egg rolls.\nThe total number of egg rolls that Patrick and Alvin ate is 2+4 = <<2+4=6>>6 egg rolls.\nMatthew ate three times as many egg rolls as Patrick ate, meaning he ate 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 egg rolls. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mikey likes his honey cluster of oats cereal.  In each spoonful, there are 4 clusters of oats.  In each bowl of cereal, he gets 25 spoonfuls of cereal.  If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, how many bowlfuls of cereal are in each box?\n", "text": "Mikey gets 4 clusters of oats in each spoonful and he gets 25 spoonfuls in each bowl.
