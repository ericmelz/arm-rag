If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?\n\nBob has a head-start of 1 mile, which means he is 1 mile ahead of Jim when they start running.\nThe difference in their speeds is 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 miles per hour.\nSo, it will take Jim 1 / 3 = <<1/3=0.3333333333333333>>0.33333 hours to catch up to Bob.\nTherefore, it will take Jim 0.33333 x 60 = <<0.33333*60=19.9998>>19.9998 minutes to catch up to Bob.\nHence, it will take Jim approximately 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

The mom ordered lobster for $25.50, the dad ordered steak for $35.00 their twin boys both ordered a cheeseburger and fries for $13.50 each.  They started their meal with an appetizer that cost 8.50.  Everyone also ordered a dessert that cost $6.00 each.  They wanted to give a 20% tip for Zach on the bill.  What did the final bill total come to?\n\nThe boys ordered a cheeseburger and fries for $13.50 each so 2 boys ordered that so that's 2*13.50 = $<<2*13.50=27.00>>27.00\nThe total cost of the meals came to 25.50+35.00+27.00 = $<<25.5+35+27=87.50>>87.50\nWith the appetizer it was 87.50+8.50 = $<<87.5+8.5=96.00>>96.00\nFor dessert, 4 people ordered dessert and each dessert costs 6.00 so they paid 4*6 = $<<4*6=24.00>>24.00\nIf we add up the cost of the food and appetizer and dessert, that comes to 96+24 = $<<96+24=120.00>>120.00\nThe bill is 120 and they want to add a 20% tip so .20*120 = $<<120*.20=24.00>>24.00\nThe bill is 120.00 and they are leaving a 24.00 tip for a grand total of 120+24 = $<<120+24=144.00>>144.00.

If those sold in bookshops outside the school cost 20% less, how much can Peter save by buying from other bookshops rather than the school's if he wants to buy 3 math textbooks?\n\nIf the textbook in the school's bookshop costs $45, a 20% reduction means its price in other bookshops is 20/100*$45 = $<<20/100*45=9>>9 less.\nThe price of a math textbook in bookshops outside the school is $45-$9= $<<45-9=36>>36\nBuying three textbooks from other bookshops costs 3*$36= $<<3*36=108>>108\nBuying three textbooks from the school's bookshop will cost 3*$45=$<<3*45=135>>135\nBy buying from other bookshops, Peter can save $135-$108 = $<<135-108=27>>27.

If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\n\nLet X be the money Isabel had at first.\nIsabel spent X / 2 on a toy.\nShe had X / 2 remaining.\nShe spent (X / 2) / 2 = X / 4 on a book.\nShe had (X / 2) - (X / 4) = X / 4 remaining.\nThus, we know X / 4 = $51.\nThus, the initial amount of money Isabel had was X = $51 * 4 = $<<51*4=204>>204.

One buyer offered to pay the full price if Chris would pay for the car maintenance inspection, which cost a tenth of Chris\u2019s asking price. The other buyer agreed to pay the price if Chris replaced the headlights for $80 and the tires for three times as much. What is the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers?\n\nChris would earn 5200 - 5200/10 = $<<5200-5200/10=4680>>4680 if he accepted the first buyer's offer.\nThe second buyer's offer will cost 80 + 80*3 = $<<80+80*3=320>>320 for the headlights and tires.\nThus, the second buyer's offer would earn Chris 5200 - 320 = $<<5200-320=4880>>4880.\nTherefore, the difference between the amounts Chris will earn is 4880 - 4680 = $<<4880-4680=200>>200.

If my total bill was $140, the sales tax in my city is 10%, I ordered a NY Striploin for $80, and I ordered a glass of wine for $10, how much did they charge me for gratuities?\n\nTo calculate the amount charged for gratuities, we first need to find the total amount before taxes by adding the cost of the NY Striploin and the glass of wine: $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of taxes by multiplying the total amount before taxes by the tax rate: $90 * 0.10 = $<<90*0.10=9>>9.\nFinally, we can calculate the total bill by adding the total amount before taxes and the amount of taxes: $90 + $9 = $<<90+9=99>>99.\nSince the total bill was $140, the amount charged for gratuities without the customer's awareness is $140 - $99 = $<<140-99=41>>41.
