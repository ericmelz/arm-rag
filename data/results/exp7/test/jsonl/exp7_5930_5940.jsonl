He spends half that journey driving 28 miles per hour and the other half driving 60 miles per hour on the highway. If Jake can bike 11 miles per hour, how many hours will it take him to bike to the water park?\n", "text": "Let's assume the distance from their house to the water park is D miles. Since Jake's dad spends half the journey driving 28 miles per hour and the other half driving 60 miles per hour, we can say that the time it takes him to drive from their house to the water park is (30 minutes / 2) = 15 minutes, or 15/60 = 0.25 hours for each half of the journey. \nThe first half of the journey, where Jake's dad drives 28 miles per hour, takes 0.25 * 28 = 7 miles. \nThe second half of the journey, where Jake's dad drives 60 miles per hour, also takes 0.25 * 60 = 15 miles. \nTherefore, the total distance from their house to the water park is 7 + 15 = 22 miles. \nIf Jake can bike 11 miles per hour, then it will take him 22 / 11 = 2 hours to bike to the water park. \n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2}."}

If he has 2 hours to write poetry, how much can he expect to earn?\n\nRikki can write poetry for a total of 2 hours x 60 minutes per hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nTherefore, he can write 120 minutes / 5 minutes per set = <<120/5=24>>24 sets of 25 words.\nSo, he can write 24 sets x 25 words per set = <<24*25=600>>600 words.\nTherefore, he can earn 600 words x $0.01/word = $<<600*0.01=6>>6. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: A kiddy gift shop sells bracelets at $4 each, keychains at $5 each, and coloring books at $3 each. Paula and Olive want to buy presents for their friends. Paula buys two bracelets and a keychain, while Olive buys a coloring book and a bracelet.  How much do Paula and Olive spend in total?\n\nTwo bracelets cost 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nSo Paula spends $8 + $5 = $<<8+5=13>>13.\nWhile Olive spends $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7>>7.\nTherefore, Paula and Olive spend $13 + $7 = $<<13+7=20>>20 in total. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Andy is a lawyer who's working on two lawsuits. The first lawsuit has a 30% chance of paying out $5,000,000 upon a win and $0 if he loses it. The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins.  Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them?\n\nFirst we find the probability of Andy winning both suits by multiplying the probabilities of each individual suit: .3 * .5 = <<.3*.5=.15>>.15.\nThen we find the probability of Andy losing both suits by multiplying the probabilities of each individual suit: .7 * .5 = <<.7*.5=.35>>.35.\nTo find the difference between these probabilities we subtract the probability of winning both suits from the probability of losing both suits: .35 - .15 = <<.35-.15=.19999999999999996>>.2.\nThis means it's 20% more likely that Andy loses both suits than wins both suits. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Alexander is going food shopping. If he buys 5 apples for $1 each and 2 oranges for $2 each, how much does he spend?\n\nAlexander buys 5 apples for $1 each, so the cost of the apples is 5 * $1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.\nHe also buys 2 oranges for $2 each, so the cost of the oranges is 2 * $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nIn total, Alexander spends $5 + $4 = $<<5+4=9>>9. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: A man is purchasing a pair of sneakers at a club store where he receives a membership discount of 10% off any purchase.  In addition to the membership discount, the man also has a coupon for $10 off any pair of sneakers.  If the man wants to purchase a $120 pair of sneakers and the membership discount must be applied after the coupon, how much will he pay for the sneakers after using both the coupon and membership discount?\n", "text": "The man's coupon gives him $10 off the $120 pair of sneakers, so the price is reduced to $120 - $10 = $110.\nThe membership discount is then applied to the reduced price, giving him 10% off $110, which is $110 * 0.1 = $11.\nTherefore, the man will pay $110 - $11 = $99 for the sneakers after using both the coupon and membership discount. Answer: \\boxed{99}."}

In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?\n\nOf his 12 roaches, Calvin has half as many crickets, so he has 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 crickets.\nOf his 3 scorpions, he has twice as many caterpillars, so he has 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 caterpillars.\nThus, in total, Calvin has 12 roaches + 3 scorpions + 6 crickets + 6 caterpillars = <<12+3+6+6=27>>27 insects.

If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: William's class set a goal each week of the number of cans of food that is to be collected. On the first day, 20 cans were collected. Then the number of cans increased by 5 each day.
