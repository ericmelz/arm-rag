In 2 years, Jacob will be exactly half of Peter\u2019s age. How old is Jacob now?\n", "text": "Let's first find the current ages of Drew and Maya. Since Drew is 5 years older than Maya, if we let Maya's age be x, then Drew's age is x+5.\n\nNext, we find the current age of Peter. Peter is 4 years older than Drew, so Peter's age is (x+5)+4 = x+9.\n\nSince John is twice as old as Maya, John's age is 2x.\n\nIn 2 years, Jacob will be exactly half of Peter's age. Let Jacob's age be y. So in 2 years, Jacob will be y+2 and Peter will be (x+9)+2 = x+11. According to the problem, y+2 = (x+11)/2.\n\nFrom the information given, we also know that John's age is 30. So we have the equation 2x = 30.\n\nTo find Jacob's current age, we solve the equation y+2 = (x+11)/2 for y. Multiplying both sides by 2, we have 2(y+2) = x+11. Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get 2y+4 = x+11.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations 2x = 30 and 2y+4 = x+11 to find the values of x and y, which represent Maya's age and Jacob's age, respectively.\n\nFrom the equation 2x = 30, we can solve for x: x = 30/2 = 15.\n\nSubstituting x = 15 into the equation 2y+4 = x+11, we have 2y+4 = 15+11. Simplifying, we get 2y+4 = 26. Solving for y, we have 2y = 26-4 = 22, so y = 22/2 = 11.\n\nTherefore, Jacob's age is 11 years old. Answer: \\boxed{11}."}
