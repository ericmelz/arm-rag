How many berries does Stacy have?\n", "text": "Let's call the number of berries Stacy has S, the number of berries Steve has T, and the number of berries Skylar has U.\n\nWe're given that Stacy has 4 times as many berries as Steve, so we can write the equation S = 4T.\n\nWe're also given that Steve has double the number of berries that Skylar has, so we can write the equation T = 2U.\n\nFinally, we're told that the three of them have a total of 1100 berries, so we can write the equation S + T + U = 1100.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution.\n\nFrom the equation T = 2U, we can substitute 2U for T in the equation S = 4T:\n\nS = 4(2U)\nS = 8U\n\nNow we can substitute 8U for S in the equation S + T + U = 1100:\n\n8U + T + U = 1100\n9U + T = 1100\n\nSince we're trying to find the number of berries Stacy has, we want to solve for S. Substituting 8U for S, we get:\n\n9U + (2U) = 1100\n11U = 1100\nU = 100\n\nNow we can find the value of S by substituting 100 for U in the equation S = 8U:\n\nS = 8(100)\nS = 800\n\nTherefore, Stacy has 800 berries.

After this, how many chickens does Wendi have?\n\nWendi brought home enough additional chickens to double the number of chickens she owned, which was 4, bringing the total to 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8.\nA neighbor's dog ate one of her chickens, leaving 8-1=<<8-1=7>>7 chickens.\nAn additional 4 less than ten chickens were brought home, 4<10=10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 additional chickens.\nBy this time, Wendi has 7+6=<<7+6=13>>13 chickens. Answer: \\boxed{13}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20. If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nIf Coraline's number is 80, Jayden's number is 80-40 = <<80-40=40>>40\nMickey's number is 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 which is 20 greater than Jayden's number.\nJayden's number is 60-20 = <<60-20=40>>40\nTogether, the three have 60+40+80 = <<60+40+80=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?\n\nLet's let 'e' stand for the number of emus in Farmer Brown's flock.\nEach emu has 2 legs.\nSo '2e' is the total number of legs for all the emus in the flock.\nAnd 'e' is the number of heads in Farmer Brown's flock.\nIf we write an equation for the total number of heads and legs, we get:\n'e + 2e = 60'\nCombining like terms, we get:\n'3e = 60'\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:\ne = 20\nSo, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Farmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?\n\nLet's assume that each emu has a head and two legs.\nLet's assume there are 'x' emus in the flock.\nThe total number of heads would be 'x'.\nThe total number of legs would be 2*x.\nFrom the given information, we know that the total number of heads and legs is 60.\nTherefore, the equation would be x + 2*x = 60.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 3*x = 60.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 20.\nSo, there are 20 emus in Farmer Brown's flock. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Matt skips ropes 3 times per second.  If he jumped for 10 minutes how many skips hops did he get?\n", "text": "If Matt skips ropes 3 times per second, he would do 3 * 60 skips in a minute, which is 180 skips per minute.\nIf he jumped for 10 minutes, he would do 180 * 10 = 1800 skips.\nTherefore, Matt did 1800 skips in 10 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{1800}."}
