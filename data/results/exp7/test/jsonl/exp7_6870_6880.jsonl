Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?\n\nThe first spacecraft traveled for 30 minutes, or 30/60=<<30/60=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nThus, we have 448=0.5x for some unknown speed x.\nThis gives x=448/0.5=<<448/0.5=896>>896 mph.\nSince the second spacecraft landed thirty minutes later, it landed at 3:30+0:30=4:00 pm.\nThus, it traveled for 60 minutes, or 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour.\nSince the distance is the same, this gives 448=1y for some unknown speed y.\nThis gives y=448/1=<<448/1=448>>448 mph.\nThe difference in speed is 896-448=<<896-448=448>>448 mph.
