If the tree grows twice as fast as the boy does, how tall will the tree be by the time the boy is 36 inches tall?\n", "text": "Let's first find out how much the boy grows each year. The boy grows 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 inches over the years.\nTherefore, the boy grows 8 inches / 1 year = <<8/1=8>>8 inches per year.\nSince the tree grows twice as fast as the boy, the tree grows 2 * 8 inches = <<2*8=16>>16 inches per year.\nTo find out how tall the tree will be when the boy is 36 inches tall, we need to find how many years it takes for the boy to grow 36 - 24 = <<36-24=12>>12 inches more.\nSince the boy grows at a rate of 8 inches per year, it will take him 12 inches / 8 inches/year = <<12/8=1.5>>1.5 years to grow 12 inches taller.\nDuring this time, the tree will grow at a rate of 16 inches/year * 1.5 years = <<16*1.5=24>>24 inches.\nThus, the tree will be 16 inches + 24 inches = <<16+24=40>>40 inches tall when the boy is 36 inches tall.
