He tells the attendant that it's his birthday so she decides to give him a 15% special discount. The price tag on the shirt says $80. How much is he supposed to pay now, considering the special discount?\n\nThe discount is 15% of $80, which is (15/100) * $80 = $<<15/100*80=12>>12.\nSo, he is supposed to pay $80 - $12 = $<<80-12=68>>68 now.

Jessica's was half the weight of Brad's.  Betty's pumpkin weight 4 times the amount of Jessica's pumpkin.  What is the difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkin in  pounds?\n\nJessica's pumpkin weighed half of Brad's so it weighed 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 pounds\nBetty's weighed 4 times the amount of Jessica's so it weighed 27*4 = <<4*27=108>>108 pounds\nThe difference between the heaviest and lightest pumpkins was 108 - 27 = <<108-27=81>>81 pounds.

What is the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped?\n\nThe total number of striped nails is 20 - 6 - 8 = <<20-6-8=6>>6.\nThe percentage of striped nails is 6/20 * 100% = 30%.\nThe difference between the percentage of blue nails and striped nails is 8/20 * 100% - 30% = 40% - 30% = <<8/20*100%-30%=10>>10%. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: James has an old printer that crumples every seventh page and blurs the ink on every third page. If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, which means it crumples 42 / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages.\nThe printer blurs the ink on every third page, which means it blurs 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages.\nHowever, some pages are both crumpled and blurred, so we need to subtract these from the total. This is because the crumpled pages are a multiple of 7, and the blurred pages are a multiple of 3, thus the multiples of the lowest common multiple are the duplicates. The printer crumples and blurs on every 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pages.\nThus, we must subtract the pages that are both crumpled and blurred, which is 42 / 21 = <<42/21=2>>2 pages.\nSo in total, he has 42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: Ms. Alice can grade 296 papers in 8 hours.

If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nLet's start by finding out how many women are at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 guests is (40/100)*200 = <<(40/100)*200=80>>80 women.\nOut of the 80 women, 80% are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 women is (80/100)*80 = <<(80/100)*80=64>>64 women.\nNow let's find out how many men are at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200 and that 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 men.\nOut of the 120 men, 60% are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 men is (60/100)*120 = <<(60/100)*120=72>>72 men.\nThe total number of people wearing rabbit ears is 64 women + 72 men = <<64+72=136>>136 people.

If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?\n\nLet's assume that there were \"x\" lions in Londolozi at first.\nAfter 12 months, the number of lion cubs born is 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60\nDuring the same period, the number of lions that died is 1 * 12 = <<1*12=12>>12\nTherefore, the total number of lions after 1 year is x + 60 - 12 = <<x+60-12=x+48>>x+48\nGiven that the total number of lions after one year is 148, then x+48 = 148.\nSo the initial number of lions at Londolozi is x = 148 - 48 = <<148-48=100>>100.

How many days will it take for Jamie's father to burn off 5 pounds if he does light exercise and sticks to eating 2000 calories a day?\n\nTo burn off 1 pound of body fat, Jamie's father needs to burn 3,500 calories,\nTherefore, to burn off 5 pounds, he needs to burn 3,500 x 5 = <<3500*5=17500>>17,500 calories.\nGiven that he burns 2,500 calories a day, and is consuming 2,000 calories a day, he is at a deficit of 2,500 - 2,000 = <<2500-2000=500>>500 calories per day.\nTherefore, it will take Jamie's father 17,500 / 500 = <<17500/500=35>>35 days to burn off 5 pounds.

How many oranges are in the bowl?\n", "text": "Let's assume the number of oranges in the bowl is represented by \"x\".\n\nThere are 2 bananas and twice as many apples as bananas, so the number of apples is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fruits in the bowl is 2 (bananas) + 4 (apples) + x (oranges) = 12.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 6 + x = 12.\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we find x = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 oranges in the bowl.
