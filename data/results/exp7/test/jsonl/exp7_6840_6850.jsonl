What is the price of the pants knowing that the price of a shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants and that the price of a shoe is ten dollars more than the price of the pants?\n\nLet x be the price of the pants.\nThe price of the shirt is (3/4)x.\nThe price of the shoes is x + 10.\nThus, the total price of the shirt, pants, and shoes is x + (3/4)x + x + 10 = $340.\nCombining like terms, we get (11/4)x + 10 = $340.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get (11/4)x = $330.\nMultiplying both sides by 4/11, we get x = $120. Answer: \\boxed{120}.\n\n\nQuestion: In a grocery store, Julia bought 2 pieces of Snickers and 3 packs of M&M's. If each piece of Snickers costs $1.5 and a pack of M&M's has the same cost as 2 Snickers, how much is Julia's change if she gave the cashier 2 $10 bills?\n\nTwo pieces of snickers amount to $1.5 x 2 = $<<1.5*2=3>>3.\nJulia bought 3 packs of M&M's which amount to $3 x 3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.\nAnd the total amount she needs to pay is $3 + $9 = $<<3+9=12>>12.\nJulia gave the cashier 2 $10 bills, so her 2 x $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20.\nTherefore her change is $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: James buys 10 boxes of Capri-sun.  Each box has 6 pouches in it.  If he paid $12 how many cents does each pouch cost?\n\nHe got 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 pouches\nSo each pouch cost 12*100/60=$<<12*100/60=20>>20 cents. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Isabella has $45 more than Sam but only $15 more than Giselle. If Giselle has $120, calculate the total amount of money each shopper will receive if Isabella, Sam, and Giselle donate the money to three shoppers at their local town's supermarket who then decides to share it equally.\n", "text": "Isabella has $15 more than Giselle, which means Isabella has $120 + $15 = $<<120+15=135>>135.\nIsabella has $45 more than Sam, which means Sam has $135 - $45 = $<<135-45=90>>90.\nTherefore, if Isabella, Sam, and Giselle donate the money to three shoppers equally, each shopper will receive $$(120 + 135 + 90)/3 = $<<(120+135+90)/3=115>>115. Answer: \\boxed{115}."}

The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?\n\nFirst find the proportion of the eggs that are blue: 4/5 * 100% = 80%\nThen find the proportion of the eggs that are purple: 1/5 * 100% = 20%\nThen find the proportion of the purple eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are purple: 1/2 * 1/5 = 1/10\nThen find the proportion of the blue eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are blue: 1/4 * 4/5 = 1/5\nThen add the proportion of purple eggs with 5 pieces of candy to the proportion of blue eggs with 5 pieces of candy to find the overall proportion with 5 pieces: 1/10 + 1/5 = 1/10 + 2/10 = 3/10\nThen multiply the proportion of eggs with 5 pieces by 100% to find the percentage chance of getting a blue egg with 5 pieces: 3/10 * 100% = 30%.

However, soldiers in the second are each given 2 pounds less food than the first side.  If the first side has 4000 soldiers and the other side 500 soldiers fewer than the first side, what's the total amount of pounds of food both sides are eating altogether every day?\n", "text": "The total amount of food consumed by the first side is 4000 soldiers * 10 pounds/soldier = 40,000 pounds of food.\nThe second side has 4000 - 500 = 3500 soldiers.\nEach soldier on the second side eats 10 - 2 = 8 pounds of food.\nThe total amount of food consumed by the second side is 3500 soldiers * 8 pounds/soldier = 28,000 pounds of food.\nTherefore, the total amount of food both sides are eating altogether every day is 40,000 pounds + 28,000 pounds = <<40000+28000=68000>>68,000 pounds.
