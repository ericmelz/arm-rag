Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nJustine initially had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, so let's assume Bailey had x rubber bands.\nSo, Justine had x + 10 rubber bands.\nJustine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, so Ylona had x + 10 + 2 = x + 12 rubber bands.\nBailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona so he had x - 2 - 2 = x - 4 rubber bands.\nSince Bailey is left with 8 rubber bands, we have x - 4 = 8.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get x = 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nSo Ylona initially had x + 12 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 rubber bands.

If she realizes a $120 profit on her sales, how many people have she sold the books to if each book costs $5 to make and every customer buys 2 at a time?\n\nIf each book costs $5 to make, she earns $20 for each book she sells, so she makes a profit of $20-$5 = $<<20-5=15>>15 for each book.\nSince a profit of $120 was made, this means she sold $120/$15 = <<120/15=8>>8 books.\nSince every customer buys 2 books at a time, this means she sold a book to 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 people.

He also sells literature books which cost half of the price of a fantasy book. If his fantasy books cost $4 each, and he sold five fantasy books and eight literature books per day, how much money will he earn after five days?\n\nVincent earns $4 x 5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 per day for selling 5 fantasy books.\nWhile he earns $4/2 = $<<4/2=2>>2 per literature book.\nSo, he earns $2 x 8 = $<<2*8=16>>16 per day for selling 8 literature books.\nTherefore, Vincent earns a total of $20 + $16 = $<<20+16=36>>36 per day.\nThus, he earns a total of $36 x 5 = $<<36*5=180>>180 after five days.

His agent takes 10% of that.  How much money did he keep not counting the money from the advance?\n", "text": "Steve sells 1,000,000 - 100,000 = <<1000000-100000=900000>>900,000 copies of the book not counting those paid for by the advance.\nFor each of these copies, he earns $2, and after his agent takes 10% of that, he keeps 100% - 10% = 90% of the earnings.\nSo, he keeps $2 x 90% = $<<2*90*.01=1.8>>1.8 for each copy sold.\nTherefore, he keeps a total of $1.8 x 900,000 = $<<1.8*900000=1620000>>1,620,000.
