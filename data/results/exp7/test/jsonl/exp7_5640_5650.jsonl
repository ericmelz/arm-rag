The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?\n\nFirst find the proportion of the eggs that are blue: 4/5 * 100% = 80%\nThen find the proportion of the eggs that are purple: 1/5 * 100% = 20%\nThen find the proportion of the purple eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are purple: 1/2 * 1/5 = 1/10\nThen find the proportion of the blue eggs that have five pieces of candy by multiplying the proportion that have five pieces by the proportion of eggs that are blue: 1/4 * 4/5 = 1/5\nThen add the proportion of purple eggs with 5 pieces of candy to the proportion of blue eggs with 5 pieces of candy to find the overall proportion with 5 pieces: 1/10 + 1/5 = 1/10 + 2/10 = 3/10\nThen multiply the proportion of eggs with 5 pieces by 100% to find the percentage chance of getting a blue egg with 5 pieces: 3/10 * 100% = 30%. Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mickey's number is greater than Jayden's number by exactly 20. If Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, and Coraline's number is 80, calculate the total of the numbers they have.\n\nIf Coraline's number is 80, and Jayden's number is 40 less than Coraline's number, Jayden's number is 80-40=<<80-40=40>>40\nThe total number of numbers is Mickey's number, which is 20 more than Jayden's number by exactly 20\nMickey's number is 40+20=<<40+20=60>>60\nIn total, the three numbers sum up to 40+60+80=<<40+60+80=180>>180.

Calculate the number of perfect apples.\n", "text": "The proportion of apples that are too small is 1/6 and the proportion of apples that are not ripe is 1/3. Therefore, the proportion of perfect apples is 1 - 1/6 - 1/3 = 1 - 1/6 - 2/6 = 1 - 3/6 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. To find the number of perfect apples, multiply the proportion by the total number of apples: 1/2 * 30 = 15. Answer: \\boxed{15}."}

The second week, she runs twice as long plus 3 extra miles per week. The third week she runs 9/7 as much as she ran the second week. The week after that, she sprains her ankle and has to reduce her running time by 5 miles per week. How many miles did she run the week she was injured?\n\nThe second week she ran 2*2 + 3 = <<2*2+3=7>>7 miles.\nThe third week she ran 9/7 * 7 = <<9/7*7=9>>9 miles.\nThe week she was injured she ran 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 miles.
