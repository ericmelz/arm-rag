Paula buys two bracelets and a keychain, while Olive buys a coloring book and a bracelet.  How much do Paula and Olive spend in total?\n\nTwo bracelets cost 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nSo Paula spends $8 + $5 = $<<8+5=13>>13.\nWhile Olive spends $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7>>7.\nTherefore, Paula and Olive spend $13 + $7 = $<<13+7=20>>20 in total. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: 400 adults and 200 children go to a Broadway show. The price of an adult ticket is twice that of a child's ticket. What is the price of an adult ticket if the total amount collected is $16,000?\n", "text": "Let the price of a child's ticket be $x. Therefore, the price of an adult ticket is $2x.\nThe total number of adults is 400, so the amount collected from adult tickets is 400 * ($2x) = $800x.\nThe total number of children is 200, so the amount collected from children's tickets is 200 * ($x) = $200x.\nThe total amount collected is $800x + $200x = $1000x.\nWe are given that the total amount collected is $16,000.\nTherefore, $1000x = $16,000.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $1000 gives us x = $16.\nSo, the price of a child's ticket is $16.\nSince the price of an adult ticket is twice that of a child's ticket, the price of an adult ticket is $16 * 2 = $<<16*2=32>>32.\nTherefore, the price of an adult ticket is $32. Answer: \\boxed{32}."}
