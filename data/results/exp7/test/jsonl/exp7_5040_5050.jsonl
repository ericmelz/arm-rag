If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12.

If Timmy's pail holds twice as much water as Tommy's, and Tommy's holds 2 gallons more than Tina's, and Tina's is 4 gallons, how much water do the three of them fill the pool with after 3 trips each?\n\nSince Tina's pail holds 4 gallons, Tommy's holds 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 gallons.\nSince Timmy's holds twice Tommy's, it holds 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 gallons.\nThree trips with each of their pails means in one trip, they dump 12+6+4=<<12+6+4=22>>22 gallons.\nSo in 3 trips they dump 22*3=<<22*3=66>>66 gallons.
