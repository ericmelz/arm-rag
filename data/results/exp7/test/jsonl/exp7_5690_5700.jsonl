Daniel received 250 stickers, while Fred received 120 more stickers than Daniel.   He kept the remaining stickers. How many stickers did Andrew keep?\n\nFred received 250 + 120 = <<250+120=370>>370 stickers.\nDaniel and Fred received 250 + 370 = <<250+370=620>>620 stickers together.\nThus, Andrew kept 750 - 620 = <<750-620=130>>130 stickers.
