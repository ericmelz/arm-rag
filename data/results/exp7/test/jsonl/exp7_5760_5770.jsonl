If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, so it crumples $42/7 = 6$ pages. The printer blurs every third page, so it blurs $42/3 = 14$ pages. However, every seventh page is both crumpled and blurred, so we must subtract these cases off to avoid double-counting. Thus, James has $42-6-14 + 2 = \\boxed{24}$ pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.\n\n\nQuestion: James decides to replace his car.  He sold his $20,000 car for 80% of its value and then was able to haggle to buy a $30,000 sticker price car for 90% of its value.

How many more females with spots are there than males with horns?\n\nLet's assume there are x males in the field.\nTherefore, there are 2x females in the field.\nThe total number of cows in the field is x + 2x = 3x = 300\nSo, the number of males in the field is x = 300 / 3 = <<300/3=100>>100.\nThere are 2 * 100 = <<2*100=200>>200 females in the field.\nHalf the females are spotted, so there are 200 / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 females with spots.\nHalf the males have horns, so there are 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 males with horns.\nTherefore, there are 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 more females with spots than males with horns.
