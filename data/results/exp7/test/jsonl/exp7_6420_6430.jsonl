Jeremy then gifted Fred an additional 37 goats. If exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, how many male animals are there in the barn?\n\nInitially, Fred had a total of 100 horses + 29 sheep + 9 chickens = <<100+29+9=138>>138 animals in the barn.\nBrian bought half of the animals, so he bought 1/2 * 138 animals = <<1/2*138=69>>69 animals.\nAfter Brian bought half of the animals, there were 138 animals - 69 animals = <<138-69=69>>69 animals left in the barn.\nJeremy gifted an additional 37 goats, so the number of animals in the barn increased to 69 animals + 37 goats = <<69+37=106>>106 animals.\nIf exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, then the number of male animals is 106 animals/2 = <<106/2=53>>53 animals.

But Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box of crayons. If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box?\n\nIf Karen's box contained 128 crayons, and it had twice as many crayons as were in Beatrice's box, then Beatrice's box contained 128/2 = <<128/2=64>>64 crayons.\nSince Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box, then Gilbert's box contained 64/2 = <<64/2=32>>32 crayons.\nGilbert's box contained four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box, meaning Judah's box had 32/4 =<<32/4=8>>8 crayons.

How many of the remaining games must they win so that their percentage of wins in the entire season is 64%?\n", "text": "The basketball team has already won 35 out of 50 games, which means they have a win percentage of 35/50 = 70% for the games played so far. They want their overall win percentage for the entire season to be 64%. \n\nLet's assume they win x out of the remaining 25 games. Adding their wins from the games played so far and the wins from the remaining games, we have a total of 35 + x wins out of 50 + 25 = 75 games.\n\nTo find the win percentage, we divide the total wins by the total number of games and multiply by 100:\n\n(35 + x) / 75 * 100 = 64\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n(35 + x) / 75 = 0.64\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n35 + x = 0.64 * 75\n35 + x = 48\n\nSubtracting 35 from both sides of the equation, we find:\n\nx = 48 - 35\nx = 13\n\nTherefore, the team must win 13 out of the remaining 25 games in order to have a win percentage of 64% for the entire season.

Then, she hung up the string of sausage links in her cooler.  Later that evening, Brandy, Sam\u2019s Golden Retriever, broke into the cooler and ate 12 links of sausage.  After Brandy\u2019s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links?\n\nSam made a total of 40 sausage links, and Brandy ate 12 of them, so there were 40 links - 12 links = <<40-12=28>>28 links remaining.\nEach link was made from a 10-pound meat mix, so the remaining links utilize only 10 pounds/ 40 links = <<10/40=.25>>.25 pounds/link.\nBecause each pound contains 16 ounces, each remaining link now has .25 pounds/link * 16 ounces/pound = 4 ounces/link.\nWith 28 links remaining, the total quantity of remaining sausage meat weighs 4 ounces/link * 28 links = <<4*28=112>>112 ounces.
