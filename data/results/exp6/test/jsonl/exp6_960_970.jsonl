If the current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees, what will the temperature decrease by?\n\nIn one hour, the temperature of Addison mountain will decrease to 3/4 of its temperature, which means it will decrease by 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of its current temperature.\nSo, the temperature of the mountain will decrease by 1/4 x 84 = <<1/4*84=21>>21 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two days ago, the temperature in the morning went up 1.5 degrees every 2 hours. If the temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M., what was the temperature at 11 A.M.?\n\nFrom 3 A.M. to 11 A.M., there are 8 hours (11 A.M. - 3 A.M. = 8 hours).\nThe number of temperature increments in 8 hours is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\nHence, the temperature increased 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 degrees.\nThus, the temperature at 11 A.M. was 50 + 6 = <<50+6=56>>56 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{56}.\n\n\nQuestion: In one hour, Addison mountain's temperature will decrease to 3/4  of its temperature. If the current temperature of the mountain is 84 degrees, what will the temperature decrease by?\n", "text": "The temperature decrease will be 84 degrees * (1 - 3/4) = 84 degrees * 1/4 = <<84*(1/4)=21>>21 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{21}."}
