The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do.  If she put $10,000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments are $600.00, how much was her loan for (including the down payment)?\n\nShe puts $10,000.00 down, so we know that 10,000 = $10,000.00 which is the down payment.\nShe pays $600.00 a month for 5 years, so she makes 12*5 = <<12*5=60>>60 monthly payments.\nTo find the loan amount, we solve the equation 600*60 = $<<600*60=36000.00>>36,000.00\nAdding the down payment of $10,000.00 to the final amount of $36,000.00 means the total loan was for 36,000 + 10,000 = <<36000+10000=46000>>46,000.

He then went to another store where he spent one-third of his starting money, and then spent $16 more. If he then had no money left, how much did he have when he entered the first store?\n\nLet X be the amount Mark had when he entered the first store.\nMark spent X/2 + $14 in the first store.\nMark spent X/3 + $16 in the second store.\nMark had X - (X/2 + $14) - (X/3 + $16) = $0 left.\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get X - (X/2 + $14) - (X/3 + $16) = $0.\nCombining like terms, we get X - X/2 - $14 - X/3 - $16 = $0.\nCombining X's, we get (6X - 3X)/6 - (2X - X)/6 - $14 - $16 = $0.\nCombining like terms, we get X/6 - $30 = $0.\nAdding $30 to both sides, we get X/6 = $30.\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get X = $<<180=180>>180.

If each piece of Snickers costs $1.5 and a pack of M&M's has the same cost as 2 Snickers, how much is Julia's change if she gave the cashier 2 $10 bills?\n\nTwo pieces of Snickers amount to $1.5 x 2 = $<<1.5*2=3>>3.\nWhile three packs of M&M's cost $3 x 3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.\nSo, Julia paid a total of $3 + $9 = $<<3+9=12>>12.\nShe gave the cashier 2 $10 bills, so she gave a total of $10 x 2 = $<<2*10=20>>20.\nTherefore, her change is $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?\n", "text": "Ann and Becky worked for 8 hours each, so together they worked for a total of 2 * 8 = 16 hours.\nThey each served 7 customers per hour, so together they served 7 * 16 = 112 customers.\nOn that day, Julia worked for 6 hours and also served 7 customers per hour, so she served a total of 6 * 7 = 42 customers.\nTherefore, all three women served a total of 112 + 42 = 154 customers that day.
