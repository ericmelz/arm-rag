Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\n\nThree bags of coals would have 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nThere are 180 / 15 = <<180/15=12>>12 periods of burning in total.\nSo the grill ran for 20 * 12 = <<20*12=240>>240. Answer: \\boxed{240}.\n\n\nQuestion: A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\n\nThe grill runs for 20 minutes per 15 coals, so it runs for 20/15 = <<20/15=1.3333333333333333>>1 and 1/3 minutes per coal.\nThe grill burns 1 bag of coals in 60 * (1 and 1/3) = 60 * 4/3 = 80 minutes.\nThree bags of coals burn for 80 * 3 = <<80*3=240>>240 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{240}.\n\n\nQuestion: A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\n\nThe grill burns 15 coals to ash every 20 minutes of grilling, so it burns 15/20 = <<15/20=0.75>>0.75 coals per minute.\nThus, one bag of coal burns for 60 / 0.75 = <<60/0.75=80>>80 minutes.\nThus, three bags of coal burn for 80 * 3 = <<80*3=240>>240 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{240}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason is mixing a batch of black paint. He needs to add 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. If he adds 900 ml of water, how much charcoal does he add?\n\nTo find out how much charcoal Jason needs to add, we can first determine the ratio of water to charcoal. This ratio is 30 ml of water for every 2 grams of charcoal.\n\nNext, we can divide the amount of water Jason is using (900 ml) by the ratio of water to charcoal:\n900 ml water / 30 ml water per 2 grams charcoal = 900/30 = <<900/30=30>>30 groups of 2 grams of charcoal.\n\nFinally, we can multiply the number of groups of charcoal (30) by the amount of charcoal in each group (2 grams) to find the total amount of charcoal needed:\n30 groups \u00d7 2 grams per group = <<30*2=60>>60 grams of charcoal. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: A charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?\n", "text": "The grill burns 15 coals in 20 minutes, so it burns 60 coals in 80 minutes (since 80 minutes is four 20-minute intervals). Therefore, one bag of coal burns for 80 minutes. Since there are three bags of coal, the grill would run for 80 x 3 = <<80*3=240>>240 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{240}."}
