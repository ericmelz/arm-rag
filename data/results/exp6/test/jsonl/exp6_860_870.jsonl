How many students do not like either food?\n\nLet's assume $x$ students liked neither of the two foods.\nHence, the number of students who liked only French fries is $15 - 6 = 9$.\nAlso, the number of students who liked only burgers is $10 - 6 = 4$.\nWe can then form the equation $9 + 4 + 6 + x = 25$, which simplifies to $19 + x = 25$.\nSubtracting 19 from both sides of the equation, we get $x = \\boxed{6}$ students.\n\n\nQuestion: During a unit on probability, a teacher surveys her class asking her students two questions.

Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jake is retrieving the notes on a communal board, putting all of the red notes in the complaints bin and all of the blue notes in the compliments bin. The red notes were in 5 rows with 6 notes in each row. There are 2 blue notes under each of the red notes, as well as another 10 blue notes scattered at the bottom of the board. How many notes in total are put into the complaints and compliments bins?\n\nThere are a total of 5 rows * 6 notes = <<5*6=30>>30 red notes.\nThere are therefore 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 blue notes under the red notes.\nIn total, there are 60 blue notes + 10 blue notes = <<60+10=70>>70 blue notes.\nSo in total, there are 30 red notes + 70 blue notes = <<30+70=100>>100 notes.
