How long will it take for her to fill the pool, in minutes?\n\nLydia's pool is filled at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, but it has a leak that drains at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute, so the effective fill rate is 1.6-0.1=<<1.6-0.1=1.5>>1.5 gallons per minute.\nIf the pool holds 60 gallons of water, it will take 60/1.5=<<60/1.5=40>>40 minutes to fill.

She fills her pool using the garden hose, which provides water at the rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.  Unfortunately, her pool has a small hole that leaks water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.  How long will it take for her to fill the pool, in minutes?\n\nWith the garden hose, Lydia fills the pool at 1.6 gallons per minute.\nHowever, the pool has a leakage, that drips away 0.1 gallons per minute.\nThis means, the net rate at which the pool fills is 1.6 - 0.1 = <<1.6-0.1=1.5>>1.5 gallons per minute.\nSince she needs to fill up 60 gallons, and the pool fills at 1.5 gallons per minute, it's basic math to see that it'll take her 60/1.5 = <<60/1.5=40>>40 minutes.

How long will it take for her to fill the pool, in minutes?\n\nLydia will have to fill the pool with 60 gallons of water at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, so it will take 60/1.6 = <<60/1.6=37.5>>37.5 minutes.\nHowever, there is a hole in the pool that leaks water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute, so she has to subtract that amount from the rate at which she is filling the pool: 1.6 - 0.1 = <<1.6-0.1=1.5>>1.5 gallons per minute.\nTo determine the time to fully fill the pool accounting for the leak, divide the number of gallons in the pool by the gallons filled per minute 60/1.5 = <<60/1.5=40>>40 minutes.

Caleb can add 7 gallons from his bucket and Cynthia can add 8 gallons from her bucket each trip. It will take 105 gallons to fill the pool. How many trips will it take for Caleb and Cynthia to fill the pool with their buckets?\n\nTogether, they can add 7 + 8 = <<7+8=15>>15 gallons of water on each trip.\nThus, it will take 105/15 = <<105/15=7>>7 trips to fill the pool. Answer: \\boxed{7}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lydia has a small pool she uses to bathe her dogs.  When full, the pool holds 60 gallons of water.

How long will it take for her to fill the pool, in minutes?\n", "text": "The pool is being filled at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, but there is a leak that drains water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute. So, the effective fill rate is 1.6 - 0.1 = 1.5 gallons per minute. To calculate the time it will take to fill the pool, we divide the total volume of the pool (60 gallons) by the fill rate (1.5 gallons per minute). Therefore, it will take 60/1.5 = 40 minutes for Lydia to fill the pool. Answer: \\boxed{40}."}
