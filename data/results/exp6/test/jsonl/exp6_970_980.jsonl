If he saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, how many wheels did he see?\n\nThe total number of wheels from the trucks is 12 trucks \u00d7 4 wheels/truck = <<12*4=48>>48 wheels.\nThe total number of wheels from the cars is 13 cars \u00d7 4 wheels/car = <<13*4=52>>52 wheels.\nTommy saw a total of 48 wheels + 52 wheels = <<48+52=100>>100 wheels.

All the trucks in his neighborhood have 4 wheels and all the cars in his neighborhood also have 4 wheels. If he saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, how many wheels did he see?\n\nTommy saw 12 trucks with 4 wheels each, so he saw 12 * 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 truck wheels.\nHe also saw 13 cars with 4 wheels each, so he saw 13 * 4 = <<13*4=52>>52 car wheels.\nTherefore, Tommy saw a total of 48 + 52 = <<48+52=100>>100 wheels.

All the trucks in his neighborhood have 4 wheels and all the cars in his neighborhood also have 4 wheels. If he saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, how many wheels did he see?\n\nThe number of wheels on the trucks is 12 trucks * 4 wheels/truck = <<12*4=48>>48 wheels.\nThe number of wheels on the cars is 13 cars * 4 wheels/car = <<13*4=52>>52 wheels.\nFor the trucks and cars, Tommy saw 48 wheels + 52 wheels = <<48+52=100>>100 wheels.

Last Saturday, the temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and he threw the ball twenty times. On Sunday, the temperature rose to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and he threw the ball 30 times. Calculate the total number of yards he threw the ball in the two days.\n\nWhen the temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit, Peyton throws the ball 20 yards per throw, so throwing it 20 times will cover a distance of 20*20=<<20*20=400>>400 yards.\nWhen the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the ball moves twice as far, meaning it moves 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40 yards in one throw.\nOn Sunday, when the temperature was 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and he threw the ball 30 times, the ball covered a distance of 30*40 = <<30*40=1200>>1200 yards.\nThe total distance the ball covered in the two days is 1200+400 = <<1200+400=1600>>1600 yards.
