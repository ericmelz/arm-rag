After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?\n\nAfter 7 minutes, Matt will be 7 minutes * 6 feet/minute = <<7*6=42>>42 feet up the tree.\nJason will be 7 minutes * 12 feet/minute = <<7*12=84>>84 feet up the telephone pole after 7 minutes.\nJason will be 84 - 42 = <<84-42=42>>42 feet higher than Matt after 7 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{42}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason is climbing a telephone pole next to a tree his friend Matt is climbing. Matt can climb 6 feet/minute and Jason can climb 12 feet per minute. After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?\n\nFirst find how many feet higher Jason climbs than Matt each minute: 12 feet/minute - 6 feet/minute = <<12-6=6>>6 feet/minute\nThen multiply that number by the number of minutes to find the total difference in their heights: 6 feet/minute * 7 minutes = <<6*7=42>>42 feet. Answer: \\boxed{42}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason is climbing a telephone pole next to a tree his friend Matt is climbing. Matt can climb 6 feet/minute and Jason can climb 12 feet per minute. After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?\n\nIn 7 minutes, Matt will have climbed 6 ft/minute x 7 minutes = <<6*7=42>>42 feet.\nIn 7 minutes, Jason will have climbed 12 ft/minute x 7 minutes = <<12*7=84>>84 feet.\nThus, Jason will be 84 feet - 42 feet = <<84-42=42>>42 feet higher than Matt.

How many square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch?\n\nTo roof the house, you will need shingles for an area of 20.5 feet by 10 feet, which is 20.5 * 10 = <<20.5*10=205>>205 square feet.\nTo roof the porch, you will need shingles for an area of 6 feet by 4.5 feet, which is 6 * 4.5 = <<6*4.5=27>>27 square feet.\nIn total, you will need shingles for 205 + 27 = <<205+27=232>>232 square feet. Answer: \\boxed{232}.\n\n\nQuestion: The house is 20.5 feet by 10 feet. The porch measures 6 feet by 4.5 feet. The house and the porch need shingles. How many square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch?\n\nTo determine the total area of shingles needed, we need to find the area of both the house and porch separately, then add them together.\n\nThe area of the house is 20.5 feet by 10 feet, so the area is 20.5 feet * 10 feet = <<20.5*10=205>>205 square feet.\n\nThe area of the porch is 6 feet by 4.5 feet, so the area is 6 feet * 4.5 feet = <<6*4.5=27>>27 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the total area of shingles needed is 205 square feet + 27 square feet = <<205+27=232>>232 square feet.

How many square feet of shingles will be needed to roof the house and the porch?\n\nTo roof the house, you need to find the area of the house's roof. The house is 20.5 feet by 10 feet, so the area is 20.5 * 10 = <<20.5*10=205>>205 square feet.\nTo roof the porch, you need to find the area of the porch's roof. The porch is 6 feet by 4.5 feet, so the area is 6 * 4.5 = <<6*4.5=27>>27 square feet.\nTo find the total area of shingles needed, add the area of the house and the porch: 205 + 27 = <<205+27=232>>232 square feet. Answer: \\boxed{232}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jerry needs to shingle 3 roofs. Each roof is made of two slanted rectangular sides measuring 20 feet by 40 feet. If he needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, how many shingles does he need total?\n\nFirst find the area of one side of a roof: 20 feet * 40 feet = <<20*40=800>>800 square feet\nThen find the total area of both sides: 2 sides * 800 square feet/side = <<2*800=1600>>1600 square feet\nThen multiply that area by the number of roofs to find the total area: 1600 square feet * 3 roofs = <<1600*3=4800>>4800 square feet\nThen multiply the total area by the number of shingles per square foot to find the total number of shingles: 4800 square feet * 8 shingles/square foot = <<4800*8=38400>>38400 shingles.
