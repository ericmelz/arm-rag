How many yellow leaves does he collect?\n\nHe collects a total of 12 + 13 = <<12+13=25>>25 oak leaves.\n20% are brown so he collects 25*.20 = <<25*.20=5>>5 brown leaves\n20% are green so he collects 25*.20 = <<25*.20=5>>5 green leaves\nHe collects a total of 5 + 5 = <<5+5=10>>10 brown and green leaves.\nThe remaining leaves are yellow or 25 - 10 = <<25-10=15>>15 yellow leaves.

The rest are yellow. How many yellow leaves does he collect?\n\nBronson collects a total of 12 + 13 = <<12+13=25>>25 leaves.\nThe number of brown leaves is 25 x 20% = <<25*20*.01=5>>5.\nThe number of green leaves is 25 x 20% = <<25*20*.01=5>>5.\nSo, the number of yellow leaves is 25 - 5 - 5 = <<25-5-5=15>>15.

He buys individual apples from farmers at a cost of $12 per bushel, and sells them to the stores at a price of $0.40 per apple.  If each bushel contains 48 apples, then how much profit, in dollars, does he make after selling 100 apples?\n\nHe buys a bushel of apples for $12, which contains 48 apples, so each apple costs 12/48 = $<<12/48=0.25>>0.25 each.\nThus, if he sells each apple for $0.40, then his profit per apple is 0.40 - 0.25 = $0.15.\nTherefore, after selling 100 apples, he makes a profit of 100 * 0.15 = $<<100*0.15=15>>15.

He then spends half his earnings on a new wheelbarrow. After buying it, someone sees it and agrees to pay the farmer double what the farmer paid and the farmer earns another $60. How many ducks did the farmer sell?\n\nLet's assume the farmer sold x ducks.\nThe earnings from selling chickens is 5 * $8 = $<<5*8=40>>40.\nThe earnings from selling ducks is x * $10 = $10x.\nThe total earnings are $40 + $10x.\nThe farmer spends half his total earnings ($40 + $10x)/2 = $20 + $5x on the wheelbarrow.\nSo without the earnings from selling the wheelbarrow, he earns another $60, which means double what he spent on the wheelbarrow.\nThat means the wheelbarrow cost him $60 / 2 = $<<60/2=30>>30.\nSo, $20 + $5x = $30.\nTherefore, $5x = $30 - $20 = $10.\nSo x = $10 / $5 = 2.\nThe farmer sold 2 ducks at the market.
