He has a grove that is 50 trees by 30 trees.  How many lemons does he produce in 5 years?\n", "text": "A normal lemon tree produces 60 lemons per year. Jim's specially engineered lemon trees produce 50% more lemons per year. \n\nIn Jim's grove, there are 50 trees by 30 trees, which is a total of 50 * 30 = 1500 trees. \n\nIf each tree produces 60 lemons per year, then Jim's specially engineered trees produce 60 * 1.5 = <<60*1.5=90>>90 lemons per year. \n\nTherefore, Jim produces a total of 90 * 1500 = <<90*1500=135000>>135,000 lemons per year. \n\nIn 5 years, Jim would produce 135,000 * 5 = <<135000*5=675000>>675,000 lemons. \n\nAnswer: \\boxed{675,000}."}

The next day, Yves ate one-fourth of the remaining pizza. Then his two siblings ate 2 slices each. How many slices of pizza were left?\n\nYves and his siblings have a total of 16 x 1 = <<16*1=16>>16 slices of pizza.\nSince they only ate 1/4 of it, then only 16 x 1/4 = <<16*1/4=4>>4 slices of pizza were eaten on the first night.\nSo, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 slices were left on the second day.\nYves ate 1/4 x 12 = <<1/4*12=3>>3 slices of pizza.\nThus, 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 slices were left after Yves ate.\nYves' siblings ate 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices of pizza.\nTherefore, only 9 - 4 = <<9-4=5>>5 slices were left.

His friend Bob would like to eat one more piece than George.  Susie will eat half as many as Bob.  Bill, Fred and Mark would each like 3 pieces.  How many slices of pizza will be left over?\n\nThree small pizzas give 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 slices.\nTwo large pizzas give 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 slices.\nGeorge wants to eat 3, Bob would like to eat 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 pieces.\nSusie would like to eat 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 pieces.\nBill, Fred and Mark each want to eat 3 pieces for a total of 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 pieces.\nThe small pizzas give 12 slices, the large pizza gives 16 slices, George wants 3, Bob wants 4, Susie wants 2 and the other three want 9 so there are 12+16-3-4-2-9=<<12+16-3-4-2-9=10>>10 slices left.
