In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?\n\nThe total number of employees after the new hires is 500 + 200 = <<500+200=700>>700 employees.\nEvery employee works for a total of 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = <<10*5=50>>50 hours/week.\nIn a month with four weeks, each employee works 50 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = <<50*4=200>>200 hours/month.\nSince all employees are paid $12/hour, they receive a monthly payment of $12/hour * 200 hours/month = $<<12*200=2400>>2400.\nSo the total amount of money the company pays its employees per month is $2400/employee * 700 employees = $<<2400*700=1680000>>1680000.

In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?\n\nIn a day, each employee is paid 10 hours * $12/hour = $<<10*12=120>>120.\nSo in a week, each employee is paid 5 days * $120/day = $<<5*120=600>>600.\nAnd in a month, each employee is paid 4 weeks * $600/week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400.\nThe company pays $2400/month/employee * 500 employees = $<<2400*500=1200000>>1200000 per month to the original employees.\nThe new hires are paid $12 * 200 employees * 10 hours/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<12*200*10*5*4=480000>>480,000.\nSo in total, the company pays $1,200,000 + $480,000 = $<<1200000+480000=1680000>>1,680,000 per month after the new hires.

In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?\n\nIn a day, each employee gets 10 * 12 = $<<10*12=120>>120.\nThis means that every week, each employee gets 120 * 5 = $<<120*5=600>>600.\nSo every month, each employee earns 600 * 4 = $<<600*4=2400>>2400.\nIf the company hires 200 more people, it hires a total of 500 + 200 = <<500+200=700>>700 people.\nThis means that before hiring the new people, the company paid 500 * 2400 = $<<500*2400=1200000>>1200000.\nSo when the company hired new people, it started paying 700 * 2400 = $<<700*2400=1680000>>1680000.

In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?\n\nThe company pays each employee 12 * 10 * 5 * 4 = $<<12*10*5*4=2400>>2400 for the month.\nThe company pays 500 * 2400 = $<<500*2400=1200000>>1200000 for the month before the new hires.\nThe company pays 200 * 2400 = $<<200*2400=480000>>480000 for the new hires.\nThe company pays 1200000 + 480000 = $<<1200000+480000=1680000>>1680000 for the month after the new hires.

If they are hired to work on 5 such similar jobs by a company that pays each of them $10 per hour, calculate the total amount of money the three will earn when they complete the jobs?\n\nIf it takes 3 men an hour to complete a job, the total number of hours they'll take to complete 5 similar jobs is 5 jobs * 1 hour/job = <<5*1=5>>5 hours.\nSince each of the men is paid $10 an hour, the total amount each of them will earn in 5 hours is 5 hours * $10/hour = $<<5*10=50>>50.\nThe three men will earn $50*3 men = $<<50*3=150>>150 when they complete the jobs.

If one foot of wire mesh is sold at $30, and she had $120000, how many feet of the field will not be fenced?\n\nTo fence the entire field, Melany needs a total of 5000 feet of wire mesh.\nOne foot of wire mesh is sold at $30, so she needs 5000*$30 = $<<5000*30=150000>>150000 worth of wire mesh.\nIf Melany had $120000, she will not be able to buy the entire length of wire mesh, so the portion of the field that will not be covered is $150000-$120000 = $<<150000-120000=30000>>30000.\nSince $30 represents 1 foot, Melany can afford to get $120000/$30 = <<120000/30=4000>>4000 feet of wire mesh.\nThe portion of the field that will not be covered is therefore 5000-4000 = <<5000-4000=1000>>1000 feet.

After one year, Mr. Brown sold the house to his other friend with a 10% loss. How much was Mr. Brown's selling price?\n\nMr. Grey's profit is $100,000 x 10/100 = $<<100000*10/100=10000>>10,000.\nSo, Mr. Grey sold the house to Mr. Brown for $100,000 + $10,000 = $<<100000+10000=110000>>110,000.\nMr. Brown's loss is $110,000 x 10/100 = $<<110000*10/100=11000>>11,000.\nTherefore, Mr. Brown sold the house for $110,000 - $11,000 = $<<110000-11000=99000>>99,000.
