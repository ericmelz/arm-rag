If he paid with a $50 bill, how much change would Simon receive back from his purchase?\n\nHe bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each so they cost 5*2.50 = $<<5*2.50=12.50>>12.50\nHe bought 5 petunias at $1.00 each so they cost 5*1 = $<<5*1=5.00>>5.00\nHe bought 1 hydrangea for $12.50, 5 pansies for $12.50 and 5 petunias for $5.00 so the total purchase amount is 12.50+12.50+5.00 = $<<12.50+12.50+5.00=30.00>>30.00\nThe garden center is offering 10% off all purchases so that's .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00\nHis total purchase is $30.00 with $3.00 off so that's 30-3 = $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00\nHe pays with a $50.00 bill so he will receive change for 50-27 = $<<50-27=23.00>>23.00.
