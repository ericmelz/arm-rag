If he makes four levels and the top level has 64 books, how many books are in the pyramid in total?\n\nIf the top level has 64 books, the level below the top has 64/0.8 = <<64/0.8=80>>80 books.\nThe level before that has 80/0.8 = <<80/0.8=100>>100 books.\nThe first level has 100/0.8 = <<100/0.8=125>>125 books.\nThe total number of books in the pyramid is 64 + 80 + 100 + 125 = <<64+80+100+125=369>>369 books.

If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?\n\nA triple word score tripled the score, so before it was worth thirty points, the score was triple the three-letter word score, or 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\nIf the first and third letters were each valued at one point, then the score from the first and third letters is 1+1=<<1+1=2>>2 points.\nThus, before the triple word score, the score from the middle letter was 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 points.
