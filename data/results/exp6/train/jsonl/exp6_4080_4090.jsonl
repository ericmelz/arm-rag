If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\n\nMitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration and 3 * $500 = $<<500*3=1500>>1500 for docking fees.\nSo he needs to keep a total of $500 + $1500 = $<<500+1500=2000>>2000.\nThus, for the boat and all additional expenses, Mitch can spend a total of $20000 - $2000 = $<<20000-2000=18000>>18000.\nSince a new boat costs $1500 per foot in length, Mitch can afford a boat that is $18000 / $1500 = <<18000/1500=12>>12 feet long.

Trevor always spends $20 more than his friend Reed on toys, and Reed spends 2 times as much money as their friend Quinn on the toys. If Trevor spends $80 every year to buy his toys, calculate how much money in total the three spend in 4 years.\n\nIf Trevor spends $20 more than Reed, then Reed spends $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 on toys.\nIf Reed spends two times as much money as their friend Quinn, then Quinn spends $60/2 = $<<60/2=30>>30 on toys.\nThe total amount of money the three men spend every year on toys is $80+$60+$30 = $<<80+60+30=170>>170\nIn four years, the three will spend $170 every year* 4 years = $<<170*4=680>>680.

If Trevor spends $80 every year to buy his toys, calculate how much money in total the three spend in 4 years.\n\nIf Trevor spends $20 more than his friend Reed on toys every year, Reed spends $80-$20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 on toys.\nSince Reed spends 2 times as much money as their friend Quinn on the toys, Quinn spends $60/2 = $<<60/2=30>>30.\nThe three spend a total of $60+$30+$80 = $170 every year to buy toys.\nIn 4 years, the three will spend $170/year * 4 years = $<<170*4=680>>680.
