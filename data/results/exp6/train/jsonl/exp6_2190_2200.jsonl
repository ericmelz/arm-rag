If Jace drives for 4 hours straight, take a 30-minute break, and then drives for another 9 hours straight, how many miles will he travel?\n\nJace drives for a total of 4 + 9 = <<4+9=13>>13 hours.\nHe drives 60 * 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 miles for the first 4 hours.\nHe drives 60 * 9 = <<60*9=540>>540 miles for the next 9 hours.\nTherefore, he drives a total of 240 + 540 = <<240+540=780>>780 miles. Answer: \\boxed{780}.\n\n\nQuestion: Every day, while going to school, Shane drives a total of 10 miles. Calculate the total distance he drives in an 80 day semester from home to school and back.\n", "text": "Shane drives a total of 10 miles per day. If we calculate the distance for one round trip from home to school and back, he drives 10 miles + 10 miles = <<10+10=20>>20 miles. \nIn an 80-day semester, he drives a total of 80 days * 20 miles/day = <<80*20=1600>>1600 miles. \nSo, the total distance Shane drives in an 80-day semester from home to school and back is 1600 miles.
