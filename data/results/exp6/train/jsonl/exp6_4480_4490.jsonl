After fifteen minutes, the cleaner has unclogged it enough that 3 ounces can run through per minute. Ten minutes later, the clog is cleared enough for 4 ounces to run through per minute. How many ounces of cleaner were used after 30 minutes?\n\nDuring the first time interval, 15 minutes, 15*2=<<15*2=30>>30 ounces of cleaner run through.\nDuring the second time interval, the next 10 minutes, 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 ounces of cleaner run through.\nTherefore, during the first two time intervals, 30+30=<<30+30=60>>60 ounces run through.\nTherefore, during the last time interval, the remaining 30-15-10=<<30-15-10=5>>5 minutes, 5*4= <<5*4=20>>20 ounces run through.\nTherefore, in total, 60+20= <<60+20=80>>80 ounces of cleaner were used.

This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?\n\nIf all three stoplights are red, the man's trip will be delayed by 3 minutes per stoplight, or a total of 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 minutes.\nTherefore, his trip will take 10+9=<<10+9=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, the man's trip will be 19-14=<<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer if he chooses the first route. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: When it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates.  The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water  per minute.  The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?\n\nThe medium-sized hole leaks water at 1/2 * 3 ounces per minute = <<1/2*3=1.5>>1.5 ounces per minute.\nThe smallest hole leaks water at 1/3 * 1.5 ounces per minute = <<1/3*1.5=0.5>>0.5 ounces per minute.\nFor every minute, the three holes combined leak at a rate of 3 + 1.5 + 0.5 ounces = <<3+1.5+0.5=5>>5 ounces per minute.\nThus, during two hours, with 60 minutes per hour, the three holes leak a combined amount of 5 ounces per minute * 120 minutes = <<5*120=600>>600 ounces.

If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?\n\nIf all three stoplights are red, the man's trip will take an additional 3 minutes per stoplight that is red, for a total of 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 minutes.\nThus, if the man chooses the first route and all three stoplights are red, his trip will take an additional 9 minutes beyond the 10 minutes it would take if all three lights were green, for a total of 10 + 9 = <<10+9=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, if the man chooses the first route, his trip will be 19 - 14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than if he took the second route.
