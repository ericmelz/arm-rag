If one ton is 2000 pounds, how many tons can the tongue of an adult blue whale weigh?\n\nThe tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 6000 pounds.\nTo find out how many tons the tongue of a blue whale weighs, we need to divide the weight in pounds by the weight of one ton.\nAs one ton is 2000 pounds, we divide 6000 pounds by 2000 pounds to find the weight in tons. 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/ton =<<6000/2000=3>>3 tons.\nTherefore, the tongue of an adult blue whale can weigh 3 tons.

Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's assume that the number of people on the first ship eaten by the deep-sea monster was \"x.\"\nIn the second hundred years, the ship had twice as many people as the first ship, so it had 2x people.\nIn the third hundred years, the ship had twice as many people as the second ship, so it had 2 * (2x) = 4x people.\nOver three hundred years, the total number of people eaten is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847.\nTherefore, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is x = 847 / 7 = <<847/7=121>>121.

If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food, how many pounds of dog food are left after a week?\n\nEach dog eats 1/2 x 2 = <<1/2*2=1>>1 pound of dog food per day.\nSo Melody's three dogs eat a total of 1 x 3 = <<1*3=3>>3 pounds of dog food per day.\nIn a week, they eat 3 x 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 pounds of dog food.\nTherefore, 30 - 21 = <<30-21=9>>9 pounds of dog food are left in a week. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Arthur has $200 in his wallet. He spends four-fifths of that. How much does he have left?\n\nArthur spends 4/5 x $200 = $<<4/5*200=160>>160.\nTherefore Arthur has $200 - $160 = $<<200-160=40>>40 left. Answer: \\boxed{40}.\n\n\nQuestion: Melody has three dogs. Each dog eats 1/2 of a pound of dog food twice a day. If Melody bought 30 pounds of dog food, how many pounds of dog food are left after a week?\n\nEach dog eats 1/2 x 2 = <<1/2*2=1>>1 pound of dog food a day.\nSo each dog eats a total of 1 x 7 = <<1*7=7>>7 pounds of dog food in a week.\nTherefore, three dogs eat a total of 7 x 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pounds of dog food in a week.\nHence, Melody has 30 - 21 = <<30-21=9>>9 pounds of dog food left.

If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\n\nFirst find the total number of green pieces: 35 pieces / .25 = <<35/.25=140>>140 pieces\nThen subtract the number of green pieces and the number of amber pieces to find the number of clear pieces: 140 pieces - 35 pieces - 20 pieces = <<140-35-20=85>>85 pieces.

If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\n\nFirst find the total number of green pieces by dividing the number of green pieces by the proportion of glass they make up: 35 pieces / .25 = <<35/.25=140>>140 pieces\nThen subtract the number of green and amber pieces from the total number to find the number of clear pieces: 140 pieces - 20 pieces - 35 pieces = <<140-20-35=85>>85 pieces.

On Sunday, he goes to church and comes back, sits down, and reads 20 pages of the book. How many pages are remaining before Jerry can finish the book?\n\nIf he read 30 pages on Saturday, the pages remaining that he hasn't read are 93-30 = <<93-30=63>>63 pages.\nWhen he reads another 20 pages on Sunday, the number of pages remaining is 63-20 = <<63-20=43>>43 pages. Answer: \\boxed{43}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jerry is sweeping up pieces of broken glass in the parking lot. He sweeps up 20 amber pieces, 35 green pieces, and some clear pieces. If the green pieces are 25% of the total glass he sweeps up, how many pieces were clear?\n", "text": "First, we need to find the total number of pieces of glass that Jerry sweeps up. Since the green pieces are 25% of the total, we can set up the equation:\n\n35 = 0.25 * Total\n\nTo solve for the total, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:\n\nTotal = 35 / 0.25 = 140\n\nNext, we need to find the number of clear pieces. We know that Jerry sweeps up 20 amber pieces and 35 green pieces, so the total number of colored pieces is 20 + 35 = 55.\n\nTo find the number of clear pieces, we subtract the number of colored pieces from the total:\n\nClear pieces = Total - Colored pieces\n               = 140 - 55\n               = 85\n\nTherefore, the number of clear pieces is 85.
