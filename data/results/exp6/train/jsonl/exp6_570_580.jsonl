He can earn $5 from trout and $4 from blue-gill. He caught five fish this Sunday. If 60% were trout, and the rest were blue-gill, how much more does he need to save before he can buy the game?\n\nThis Sunday, 60% of his catch was trout so he caught 5 fish * 0.60 = <<5*0.6=3>>3 trout\nThis leaves 5 fish - 3 trout = <<5-3=2>>2 blue-gill\nHe earns $5 per trout * 3 trout = $<<5*3=15>>15\nHe earns $4 per blue-gill * 2 blue-gill = $<<4*2=8>>8\nHis total earnings are $15 + $8 + $35 = $<<15+8+35=58>>58\nTo save enough money, he needs $60 - $58 = $<<60-58=2>>2 more.
