How many men are there?\n\nLet M be the number of men in the engineering department.\nThe percentage of men in the department is M / (M + 180) = 70/100 = 0.7.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by (M + 180), we get M = 0.7 * (M + 180).\nMultiplying out the brackets, we get M = 0.7 * M + 126.\nSubtracting 0.7 * M from both sides of the equation, we get 0.3 * M = 126.\nDividing both sides by 0.3, we get M = 126 / 0.3 = 420.
