Answer: \\boxed{184}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bobby received his weekly paycheck today.  Although his salary is $450 per week, his actual paycheck is reduced in size because there are some taxes, insurance payments, and fees removed from his pay before his employer writes the check.  If the government removes 1/3 in federal taxes and 8% in state taxes, the health insurance removes $50 per week, the life insurance removes $20 per week, and the city charges him a fee of $10 per week for parking, then what is the final amount left in Bobby's paycheck, in dollars?\n\nFirst, Bobby's paycheck will be reduced by $450 * 1/3 = $<<450*1/3=150>>150 for federal taxes.\nThen, Bobby's paycheck will be reduced by $450 * 8/100 = $<<450*8/100=36>>36 for state taxes.\nThen, Bobby's paycheck will be reduced by $50 + $20 + $10 = $<<50+20+10=80>>80 for health insurance, life insurance, and parking fees.\nThus, Bobby's final amount left in his paycheck is $450 - $150 - $36 - $80 = $184.

Although his salary is $450 per week, his actual paycheck is reduced in size because there are some taxes, insurance payments, and fees removed from his pay before his employer writes the check.  If the government removes 1/3 in federal taxes and 8% in state taxes, the health insurance removes $50 per week, the life insurance removes $20 per week, and the city charges him a fee of $10 per week for parking, then what is the final amount left in Bobby's paycheck, in dollars?\n\nBobby's weekly paycheck before any reductions is $450.\nFirst, let's find the amount of the federal tax by multiplying the weekly paycheck by the tax rate: $450 * 1/3 = $<<450*1/3=150>>150.\nThen, let's find the amount of the state tax by multiplying the weekly paycheck by the tax rate: $450 * 8% = $<<450*8*.01=36>>36.\nNow let's find Bobby's paycheck after the federal and state tax reductions: $450 - $150 - $36 = $<<450-150-36=264>>264.\nNow let's subtract the cost of the health insurance: $264 - $50 = $<<264-50=214>>214.\nNow let's subtract the cost of the life insurance: $214 - $20 = $<<214-20=194>>194.\nFinally, let's subtract the cost of the city fee for parking: $194 - $10 = $<<194-10=184>>184. Answer: \\boxed{184}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bobby needs to buy a new pair of fancy shoes.  He decides to go to a cobbler and get them handmade.  The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.  He then charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes.  The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, since it is his first pair of shoes.  How much did Bobby pay?\n\nIt cost 75*8=$<<75*8=600>>600 of work.\nThis means the labor charge was 600*.8=$<<600*.8=480>>480.\nSo in total, Bobby paid 480+250=$<<480+250=730>>730.

To find the amount of federal taxes removed from his paycheck, we multiply his salary by 1/3:\n\n$450 * 1/3 = $150\n\nSo, $150 is removed from his paycheck for federal taxes. \n\nTo find the amount of state taxes removed, we multiply his salary by 8%:\n\n$450 * 8% = $36\n\nSo, $36 is removed from his paycheck for state taxes.\n\nIn addition to taxes, Bobby's paycheck is reduced by $50 for health insurance, $20 for life insurance, and $10 for parking fees. \n\nSo, the total amount removed from Bobby's paycheck is $150 + $36 + $50 + $20 + $10 = $266.\n\nTo find the final amount left in Bobby's paycheck, we subtract the total deductions from his salary:\n\n$450 - $266 = $184\n\nTherefore, the final amount left in Bobby's paycheck is $184.
