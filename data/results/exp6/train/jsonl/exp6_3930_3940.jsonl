Her brother, Riley, is awake for 3/4 of the day and spends 1/3 of his day outside and the rest inside. How much time, on average, do they spend inside?\n\nWe know Jonsey is awake for 2/3 of the day, so she is awake for (2/3)*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 hours.\nOf the time Jonsey is awake, she spends 1/2 playing outside, so she spends (1/2)*16 = <<1/2*16=8>>8 hours playing outside.\nThis means Jonsey spends 16 - 8 = <<16-8=8>>8 hours inside.\nWe know Riley is awake for 3/4 of the day, so he is awake for (3/4)*24 = <<3/4*24=18>>18 hours.\nOf the time Riley is awake, he spends 1/3 playing outside, so he spends (1/3)*18 = <<1/3*18=6>>6 hours playing outside.\nThis means Riley spends 18 - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 hours inside.\nOn average, Jonsey and Riley spend (8 + 12)/2 = <<(8+12)/2=10>>10 hours inside.

Her brother, Riley, is awake for 3/4 of the day and spends 1/3 of his day outside and the rest inside. How much time, on average, do they spend inside?\n\nFirst figure out how many hours Jonsey spends awake: 2/3 * 24 hours = <<2/3*24=16>>16 hours\nThen figure out how many hours each day Jonsey spends playing outside: 16 hours * 1/2 = <<16*1/2=8>>8 hours\nThen subtract that time from the total time spent awake to find how much time Jonsey spends inside: 16 hours - 8 hours = <<16-8=8>>8 hours\nThen figure out how many hours Riley spends awake: 3/4 * 24 hours = <<3/4*24=18>>18 hours\nThen figure out how many hours each day Riley spends playing outside: 18 hours * 1/3 = <<18*1/3=6>>6 hours\nThen subtract that time from Riley's total time awake to find how much time he spends inside: 18 hours - 6 hours = <<18-6=12>>12 hours\nThen add up the amount of time each child spends inside to find the total time spent inside: 12 hours + 8 hours = <<12+8=20>>20 hours\nThen divide that amount by 2 to find out how much time they spend inside, on average: 20 hours / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 hours.

How many games did Carla win?\n\nIf Carla represents C, and Frankie represents F, then it states that C+F=30..Frankie wins half as many games as does Carla, so if we represent the games Frankie wins as X, then C=2X, if we add those statements together, we get C+F=30 so 2X+X=30..combining like terms, we get 3X=30..translating that into X by dividing both sides by 3, we get X=10..so if X=10, then Carlos won 10*2= <<10*2=20>>20 games.
