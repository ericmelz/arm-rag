This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?\n\nKristy's monthly earnings from her basic salary are 7.50 x 160 = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200\nHer commission for the month is 16/100 x 25000 = $<<16/100*25000=4000>>4000.\nSo, her total monthly earnings are 1200 + 4000 = $<<1200+4000=5200>>5200.\nHer monthly budget is 95/100 x 5200 = $<<95/100*5200=4940>>4940.\nTherefore, Kristy allocated 5200 - 4940 = $<<5200-4940=260>>260 to insurance.
