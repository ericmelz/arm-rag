If there are 300 animals on the street, what's the total number of legs of dogs that are on the street?\n\nIf two-thirds of all the animals on the street are cats, then three-thirds (or the total) would be 2*(300/3) = <<2*(300/3)=200>>200 animals.\nThe number of dogs on the street is 300 - 200 = <<300-200=100>>100\nEach animal has four legs, so the total number of dog legs is 100*4 = <<100*4=400>>400 legs. Answer: \\boxed{400}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 14 more kittens than two times the number of puppies at the animal shelter. If there are 32 puppies at the shelter, how many kittens are there?\n\nTwo times the number of puppies is 32*2=<<32*2=64>>64\nThe number of kittens is 64+14=<<64+14=78>>78. Answer: \\boxed{78}.\n\n\nQuestion: An animal shelter recently took in twelve cats. The shelter already had half that number of cats. Two days later, three had been adopted. The next day, one of the cats had five kittens, and one person arrived to pick up one of the cats that was their missing pet. How many cats does the shelter have now?\n", "text": "The shelter started with 12 cats and already had half that number, so it had 12 / 2 = 6 cats already.\nAfter two days, 3 had been adopted, so there were 6 (initial cats) + 12 (new cats) - 3 (adopted cats) = 15 cats.\nOne of the cats had five kittens, so now there are 15 (existing cats) + 5 (new kittens) = 20 cats.\nSomeone picked up their missing cat, so now there are 20 (existing cats) - 1 (missing cat) = 19 cats. Answer: \\boxed{19}."}
