Answer: \\boxed{13}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mary and Ann are going sledding. Mary slides down a hill that's 630 feet long at a speed of 90 feet/minute. Ann slides down a hill that's 800 feet long at a rate of 40 feet/minute. How much longer does Ann's trip take than Mary?\n\nFirst find how long it takes Mary to slide down her hill by dividing the length by her speed: 630 feet / 90 feet/minute = <<630/90=7>>7 minutes\nThen do the same thing for Ann to find out how long it takes her: 800 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<800/40=20>>20 minutes\nThen subtract Mary's time from Ann's time to find the difference: 20 minutes - 7 minutes = <<20-7=13>>13 minutes.
