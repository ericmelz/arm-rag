What would be the total time she's taken to finish all the paintings if she paints 20 more paintings?\n\nIf Hadassah took six hours to paint 12 paintings, then the average time she took for each painting is 6/12=<<6/12=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nIf she took 0.5 hours to paint one painting, she would take 0.5*20 = <<0.5*20=10>>10 hours to finish painting the additional twenty paintings\nThe total time she has taken to finish all the paintings is 10+6 = <<10+6=16>>16 hours. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: Marcus has received a commission for as many paintings as possible. Marcus plans out his drawings so that his client can receive some of the paintings as soon as possible but it is still going to take a long time. On the first day, he paints 2 paintings. He then paints every day and each day, he paints twice as many paintings as he painted the day before. If he paints for 5 days, how many paintings will he have painted in total?\n\nOn the first day, he paints 2. On the second day, he paints 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 paintings\nOn the third day, he paints 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 paintings.\nOn the fourth day, he paints 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 paintings\nOn the fifth day, he paints 16*2=<<16*2=32>>32 paintings\nIn 5 days, he will have painted 2+4+8+16+32=<<2+4+8+16+32=62>>62 paintings. Answer: \\boxed{62}.\n\n\nQuestion: Hadassah took six hours to paint 12 paintings.
