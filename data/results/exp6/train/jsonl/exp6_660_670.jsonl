Altogether, the lifespan of the animals is 30 years. What is the lifespan of the bat?\n\nLet's represent the lifespan of a bat as x.\nTherefore, the lifespan of a hamster is x - 6.\nAnd the lifespan of a frog is 4(x - 6) = 4x - 24.\nAltogether, the lifespan of these animals is x + (x - 6) + (4x - 24) = 30.\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 6x - 30 = 30.\nAdding 30 to both sides of the equation, we get: 6x = 60.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get: x = 10.\nTherefore, the lifespan of the bat is x = 10 years.
