They are also charged $10.00 for parking and an additional $5.00 per person entrance fee.  How much will it cost to go to the concert?\n\nThe tickets cost $50.00 each and there is a 15% processing fee, 50*.15 = $<<50*.15=7.50>>7.50 per ticket to process\nThe tickets are $50.00 and there is a $7.50 processing fee so they cost 50+7.50 = $<<50+7.50=57.50>>57.50 per ticket\nThey need 2 tickets and the tickets are $57.50 each so they will pay 2*57.50 = $<<2*57.50=115.00>>115.00\nThe parking is $10.00 and they have to pay $5.00 per person for an entrance fee and there are 2 people going so they have to pay 5*2 = $<<5*2=10.00>>10.00\nThe tickets are $115.00, parking is $10.00 and there is an additional $10.00 fee so their total is 115+10+10 = $<<115+10+10=135.00>>135.00.

They are also charged $10.00 for parking and an additional $5.00 per person entrance fee.  How much will it cost to go to the concert?\n\nTwo tickets cost 2*$50.00 = $<<2*50=100.00>>100.00\nThe processing fee is $100.00*0.15 = $<<100*0.15=15.00>>15.00\nThat means the tickets are $100.00+$15.00 = $<<100+15=115.00>>115.00\nThe entrance fee is $5.00 per person so if Seth and his brother go then it\u2019s 2*$5.00 = $<<2*5=10.00>>10.00\nTogether, entrance fees and parking will cost $10.00+$10.00 = $<<10+10=20.00>>20.00\nThis means it will cost $115.00+$20.00 = $<<115+20=135.00>>135.00.

She sells 4 to her parents, 1 to her grandfather, 2 to the next-door neighbor and twice that amount to another neighbor.  How much money did Maggie earn?\n\nShe earns $5/sale and sells 4 subscriptions, so her parents cover 4*$5=$<<5*4=20.00>>20.00 in magazine subscriptions.\nShe earns $5/magazine sold and sells 1 magazine to her grandfather, so he covers 1*$5=$<<5*1=5.00>>5.00 in magazine subscriptions.\nShe earns $5/magazine sold and sells a total of 2 magazines to the next door neighbor, so this neighbor covers 2*$5=$<<5*2=10.00>>10.00 in magazine subscriptions.\nShe gets 2*$5=$<<2*5=10.00>>10.00/sale from one neighbor and sells twice that amount, so these 2 neighbors pay her additional 2*$10.00=$<<2*10=20.00>>20.00.\nIn total, she earns $20.00 from her parents, $5.00 from her grandfather, $10.00 from her next door neighbor, and $20.00 from her additional subscriptions making a grand total of $20+$5+$10+$20=$<<20+5+10+20=55.00>>55.00.

Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's assume that the first ship had x number of people on it.\nAccording to the problem, the second ship had twice as many people as the first ship, so it had 2x people on it.\nSimilarly, the third ship had twice as many people as the second ship, so it had 4x people on it.\nIn general, we can say that the nth ship had 2^(n-1)x people on it.\nOver three hundred years, the sum of people eaten by the monster is 847 people.\nSo, we can write it as: x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^(n-1)x = 847\nThis is a geometric series, and we can calculate its sum using the formula:\nSum = (first term * (1 - r^n)) / (1 - r), where r is the common ratio.\nIn this case, the common ratio is 2 (as each ship has twice as many people as the previous one), and we want to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\nSo, the equation becomes: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (1 - 2) = 847\nSimplifying further, we get: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (-1) = 847\nOr, x * (2^n - 1) = 847\nLet's solve this equation for n = 3 (as we know the sum of people eaten is 847).\nx * (2^3 - 1) = 847\nx * 7 = 847\nx = 847 / 7\nx = 121\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years.

He again went up 7 floors and found that he is 9 floors away from the top of the building. How many floors does the building have?\n\nLet x be the number of floors in the building.\nAfter going up 5 floors, Earl is on the first floor + 5 = <<5+1=6>>6th floor.\nAfter going down 2 floors, Earl is on the 6th floor - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4th floor.\nAfter going up 7 floors, Earl is on the 4th floor + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11th floor.\nSince Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building, then x - 11 = 9.\nTherefore, the building has x = 9 + 11 = <<9+11=20>>20 floors.

She spends 30 minutes on the piano, 25 minutes writing music on her computer, and 38 minutes reading about the history of the piano. Her final work is to use a special finger exerciser. How much time does she have left to use this?\n\nJoan has already spent 30 + 25 + 38 = <<30+25+38=93>>93 minutes on her music practice.\nShe has 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes in total.\nTherefore, Joan has 120 - 93 = <<120-93=27>>27 minutes left to use the finger exerciser.
