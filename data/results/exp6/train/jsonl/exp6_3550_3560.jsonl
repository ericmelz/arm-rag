If the pool holds 2000 L of water, how many times can people jump in the pool before Jim has to clean it?\n\nThe pool holds 2000 L *1000 ml/L = <<2000*1000=2000000>>2,000,000 ml of water.\nIt is cleaned when the amount of water left in the pool is less than 80% * 2,000,000 ml, or 1,600,000 ml of water.\nJim needs to fill the pool by 2,000,000 ml - 1,600,000 ml = <<2000000-1600000=400000>>400,000 ml.\nEach person jumps, Jim needs to replace an extra 400,000 ml / 400 ml/jump = <<400000/400=1000>>1000 people.

Jim has to get everyone out of the pool, clean, and refill it when it gets below 80% full. If the pool holds 2000 L of water, how many times can people jump in the pool before Jim has to clean it?\n\nFirst, find how many liters of water are in 400 ml: 400 ml * 1 L/1000 ml = <<400*1/1000=0.4>>.4 L\nThen subtract that amount from the total capacity of the pool to find how much water can be lost before it needs to be cleaned: 2000 L * .2 = <<2000*.2=400>>400 L\nFinally, divide that amount by the amount of water lost with each jump to find the number of jumps before cleaning: 400 L / .4 L/jump = <<400/.4=1000>>1000 jumps.

If the pool holds 2000 L of water, how many times can people jump in the pool before Jim has to clean it?\n\nFirst find how many liters of water are in the pool when it's 80% full: 2000 L * .8 = <<2000*.8=1600>>1600 L\nThen subtract that amount from the pool's total capacity to find how much water can splash out before Jim has to refill it: 2000 L - 1600 L = <<2000-1600=400>>400 L\nThen convert that amount to milliliters: 400 L * 1000 ml/L = <<400*1000=400000>>400,000 ml\nThen divide that amount by the amount of water that splashes out with each jump to find how many jumps are in the pool before it needs cleaning: 400,000 ml / 400 ml/jump = <<400000/400=1000>>1000 jumps.

Answer: \\boxed{1000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bob runs 6 miles per hour. His friend Jim runs at 9 miles per hour. If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?\n\nBob has a head-start of 1 mile, which means he is 1 mile ahead of Jim when they start running.\nThe difference in their speeds is 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 miles per hour.\nSo, it will take Jim 1 / 3 = <<1/3=0.3333333333333333>>0.33333 hours to catch up to Bob.\nTherefore, it will take Jim 0.33333 x 60 = <<0.33333*60=19.9998>>19.9998 minutes to catch up to Bob.\nHence, it will take Jim approximately 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.

If the pool holds 2000 L of water, how many times can people jump in the pool before Jim has to clean it?\n", "text": "The pool can hold 2000 L of water. Jim has to clean it when the water level drops below 80% of its capacity. \n\nFirst, find the water level that corresponds to 80% of the pool's capacity: 2000 L * 0.8 = 1600 L.\n\nNext, determine the amount of water that needs to be refilled: 2000 L - 1600 L = 400 L.\n\nSince each jump causes 400 ml of water to splash out, convert 400 L to milliliters: 400 L * 1000 ml/L = 400,000 ml.\n\nFinally, divide the total amount of water that can be lost (400,000 ml) by the amount of water lost with each jump (400 ml) to find the number of jumps before Jim has to clean the pool: 400,000 ml / 400 ml per jump = 1000 jumps.\n\nTherefore, Jim has to clean the pool after 1000 jumps.
