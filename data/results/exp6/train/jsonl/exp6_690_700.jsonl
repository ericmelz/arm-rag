If he takes route A, it will take him 5 hours to arrive; but if he takes route B, it will only take him 2 hours to arrive at his destination. How much time will he save if he takes route B to Boston and back to his home?\n\nIf he takes route B to Boston, it will take him 2 hours to arrive. Since he will be returning home, he will spend 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours on the round trip.\nIf he takes route A, it will take him 5 hours to arrive. Since he will be returning home, he will spend 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours on the round trip.\nIf he takes route B, he will save 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 hours.

Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: On a 16 GB (gigabyte) capacity USB drive, 50% is already busy. Calculate the number of gigabytes still available.\n", "text": "50% of 16 GB is equal to 0.5 * 16 GB = <<0.5*16=8>>8 GB.\nTherefore, there are 16 GB - 8 GB = <<16-8=8>>8 GB still available. Answer: \\boxed{8}."}

Each student gets a hamburger, which costs $2.10, some carrots, which cost $0.50, and a cookie, which cost $0.20. How much does one lunch for all the students cost?\n", "text": "First, we need to calculate the total number of third graders. Since there are 5 third grade classes with 30 students each, we have a total of 5 * 30 = 150 third graders.\nNext, we calculate the total number of fourth graders. With 4 fourth grade classes and 28 students in each class, the total number of fourth graders is 4 * 28 = 112.\nSimilarly, there are 4 fifth grade classes with 27 students each, resulting in a total of 4 * 27 = 108 fifth graders.\nTo find the total number of students, we add the number of students from each grade: 150 + 112 + 108 = 370 students in total.\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers. Each student receives a hamburger, which costs $2.10. Therefore, the total cost of hamburgers is 370 * $2.10 = $777.\nSimilarly, the cost of carrots for each student is $0.50, resulting in a total cost of 370 * $0.50 = $185.\nLastly, the cost of cookies for each student is $0.20, leading to a total cost of 370 * $0.20 = $74.\nTo find the total cost for one lunch for all the students, we add the costs of hamburgers, carrots, and cookies: $777 + $185 + $74 = $1036.\nHence, one lunch for all the students would cost $1036.
