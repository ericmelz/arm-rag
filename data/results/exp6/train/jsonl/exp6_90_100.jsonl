One day, starting with a new, 12-cup bag of kibble, Mary gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the morning and 1 cup of kibble in the evening, But on the same day, Frank also gave Luna 1 cup of kibble in the afternoon and twice as much in the late evening as he had given Luna in the afternoon.  The next morning, how many cups of kibble will Mary find remaining in the bag?\n\nIn the morning and evening, Mary fed Luna 1+1=<<1+1=2>>2 cups of kibble.\nIn the afternoon, Frank fed Luna 1 cup of kibble, and then 2*1=<<1*2=2>>2 cups of kibble in the late evening.\nThus, between Frank's afternoon and late-evening feedings, Luna was fed 1+2=<<1+2=3>>3 cups of kibble.\nCombined, Mary and Frank fed Luna 2+3= <<2+3=5>>5 cups of kibble in one day.\nThus, the next morning, Mary will find 12-5=<<12-5=7>>7 cups of kibble remaining in the bag.

How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?\n\nWorking at his regular pace all day other than the extra 2 hours would be $80 for 8+2=<<80/(8+2)=8>>8 hours.\nSo in total, for 10 hours worked, he earns $80+$20=$<<80+20=100>>100\nTherefore, in total, he would make $100/10=$<<100/10=10>>10 an hour.

He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?\n\nFirst find the number of hours John works in a year: 8 hours/day * 365 days/year = <<8*365=2920>>2920 hours/year\nThen multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly rate to find his yearly earnings without the bonus: $80/day * 365 days/year = $<<80*365=29200>>29200/year\nThen find the number of hours he works if he earns the bonus: 8 hours/day + 2 hours/day = <<8+2=10>>10 hours/day\nThen divide the money he makes by the number of hours he works to find his hourly rate with the bonus: ($80/day + $20/day)/10 hours/day = $<<100/10=10>>10/hour.

He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of hours John works with the bonus by adding the 8 hours he already works to the 2 extra hours: 8 hours + 2 hours = <<8+2=10>>10 hours\nThen we subtract the $80 he makes without the bonus from the $100 he makes with the bonus to find the bonus amount: $100 - $80= $<<100-80=20>>20\nThen we divide that bonus amount by the number of hours John works (10 hours) to find his hourly bonus rate: $20 / 10 hours = $<<20/10=2>>2/hour\nThen we add his usual hourly wage to find his total hourly wage: $2/hour + $8/hour = $<<2+8=10>>10/hour.

If he earns an extra $20 a day, his total earnings with the bonus are $80 + $20 = $100.\n\nTherefore, his hourly wage with the bonus is $100/10 = $10/hour. \n\nSo, John makes $10 per hour if he decides to earn the bonus.
