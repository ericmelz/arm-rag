On two days he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day and half the maximum time for the next two days. How many hours did William ride his horse during those 6 days?\n\nWilliam was at the maximum of his riding time twice, so he rode his horse for 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours\nFor two days he rode the horse only 1.5 hours a day so for those two days William rode for 2 * 1.5 = <<2*1.5=3>>3 hours\nOn the next two days, he rode half the maximum time, so he rode 0.5 * 6 = <<0.5*6=3>>3 hours each day.\nSo for those two days, he was riding for 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hours.\nSo for those 6 days, William rode his horse for 12 + 3 + 6 = <<12+3+6=21>>21 hours. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: William is a jockey. He can ride his horse for 6 hours a day. Over 6 days, he only used the maximum riding time twice.  On two days he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day and half the maximum time for the next two days. How many hours did William ride his horse during those 6 days?\n\nWilliam rode 6 hours in each of the first two days, so he used the maximum time for two days * 6 hours/day = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.\nOn two other days, he rode his horse for half the maximum time, so for two days * 6 hours/day * 0.5 = <<2*6*0.5=6>>6 hours.\nOn two other days, William rode his horse for only 1.5 hours, so for two days * 1.5 hours/day = <<2*1.5=3>>3 hours.\nThat means during those six days William rode his horse for 12 hours + 6 hours + 3 hours = <<12+6+3=21>>21 hours. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: William is a jockey. He can ride his horse for 6 hours a day. Over 6 days, he only used the maximum riding time twice.  On two days he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day and half the maximum time for the next two days. How many hours did William ride his horse during those 6 days?\n\nWilliam used only 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours of the maximum riding time in total.\nOn two days he used the maximum riding time, so on two others, he rode for the minimum amount of time, which is 1.5 hours.\nSo in total for two days William rode 1.5 * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 hours.\nDuring the next two days, he rode for half the maximum time, so he used half * 6 = 3 hours per day.\nSo in total for two days William made 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours.\nSo in total for these six days William rode his horse for 12 + 3 + 6 = <<12+3+6=21>>21 hours.

He typically spends 4 minutes washing a car\u2019s windows, 7 minutes washing the car body, 4 minutes cleaning the tires, and 9 minutes waxing the car. This morning he washed 2 normal cars and one big SUV, which took twice as long as a normal car. How many minutes did William spend washing all the vehicles?\n\nWilliam spends, in total, 4 + 7 + 4 + 9 = <<4+7+4+9=24>>24 minutes washing a normal car.\nHe washed 2 normal cars, so he spent 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 minutes on normal cars.\nThe SUV took twice as long, so William spent 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 minutes washing the SUV.\nAltogether, William spent 48 + 48 = <<48+48=96>>96 minutes washing all the vehicles. Answer: \\boxed{96}.\n\n\nQuestion: William is a jockey. He can ride his horse for 6 hours a day. Over 6 days, he only used the maximum riding time twice.

So in total, he rode for 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours.\nTherefore, during those 6 days, William rode his horse for 12 + 3 + 6 = <<12+3+6=21>>21 hours. Answer: \\boxed{21}."}

The number of green shoes is equal to the number of purple shoes.

Starting in the morning, Emerson rowed and was 6 miles away from his starting point on a particular weekend. He continued for another 15 miles at a constant speed, only stopping for a while for rest before covering the remaining 18 miles. What's the total distance covered by Emerson on his trip?\n\nWhen Emerson rowed the initial 6 miles, the total distance he rowed to cover the trip became 6 miles.\nHe continued 15 more miles, which added up to the total distance that Emerson rowed for the trip, which became 6+15 = <<6+15=21>>21 miles.\nEmerson then covered the remaining 18 miles to make a total of 21+18 = <<21+18=39>>39 miles. Answer: \\boxed{39}.\n\n\nQuestion: Peter and Andrew like to run in the morning.  Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew's 2 miles.

During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.
