How much does she pay total?\n\nThe ballet slippers cost 60 * (2/3) = $<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 each.\nFive pairs of ballet slippers cost 40 * 5 = $<<5*40=200>>200 in total.\nSo Fern pays 200 + 60 = $<<200+60=260>>260 total. Answer: \\boxed{260}.\n\n\nQuestion: Fern buys one pair of high heels for $60 and five pairs of ballet slippers for 2/3rds of the price of the high heels. How much does she pay total?\n\nFirst find the price of the ballet slippers: $60 * 2/3 = $<<60*2/3=40>>40/pair\nThen multiply that price by the number of pairs to find the total cost of the ballet slippers: $40/pair * 5 pairs = $<<40*5=200>>200\nThen add that amount to the cost of the high heels to find Fern's total cost: $200 + $60 = $<<200+60=260>>260.

How much does she pay total?\n", "text": "To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the ballet slippers. Since the ballet slippers cost 2/3 of the price of the high heels, we can multiply 2/3 by $60 to find the cost of one pair of ballet slippers, which is $40. \n\nNext, we multiply the cost of one pair of ballet slippers by the number of pairs Fern buys, which is 5. So, the total cost of the ballet slippers is $40 * 5 = $200. \n\nFinally, we add the cost of the high heels to the cost of the ballet slippers to find the total cost. The cost of the high heels is $60. Therefore, Fern pays a total of $60 + $200 = $260. \n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{260}$."}
