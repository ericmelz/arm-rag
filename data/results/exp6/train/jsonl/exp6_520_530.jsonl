Five of the layers are limestone. Half of the rest are sandstone. Four of the remaining are quartz. Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nLet's work through the information provided step by step.\nWe know that there are 25 different layers in total.\nOut of these 25 layers, 5 are limestone, which means that there are 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 layers remaining.\nHalf of the rest are sandstone, so there are 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 layers of sandstone.\nNow there are 20 - 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 layers left, which are not limestone or sandstone.\nFour of these remaining layers are quartz, so there are 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 layers left that are not limestone, sandstone, or quartz.\nOut of these 6 layers, half are shale, which means there are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 layers of shale.\nFinally, the remaining layers are all different kinds of rock. These are 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 layers.\nTherefore, there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata.

Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nIf there are 25 layers of rock and 5 are limestone, then there are 25-5 = <<25-5=20>>20 layers of rock that are not limestone.\nIf half of the rest are sandstone, then there are 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 layers of rock that are not limestone or sandstone.\nIf 4 of the remaining are quartz, then there are 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 layers of rock that are not limestone, sandstone, or quartz.\nIf half of the rest are shale, then there are 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 layers of rock that are not limestone, sandstone, quartz, or shale.\nTherefore, there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the strata.

Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nLet's start with the total number of layers minus the limestone layers: 25 layers - 5 layers = <<25-5=20>>20 layers.\nHalf of the remaining 20 layers are sandstone: 20 layers / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 layers.\nFour of the remaining 10 layers are quartz: 10 layers - 4 layers = <<10-4=6>>6 layers.\nHalf of the remaining 6 layers are shale: 6 layers / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 layers.\nSo, there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the strata.

Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\nOut of the 25 layers, 5 are limestone. So, the rest of the layers are 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20.\nHalf of the remaining layers are sandstone, which is 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10.\nFour layers are quartz, so the remaining layers are 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6.\nHalf of the remaining layers are shale, which is 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3.\nSo, the remaining layers are all different kinds of rocks, which means there are 3 kinds of rock that make up only one layer in the canyon's strata. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: A four-layer pyramid is being built with each layer having three times as many sandstone blocks as the layer above it. The top layer is a single block. How many sandstone blocks are in the pyramid?\n\nLet's start by finding how many blocks are in the second layer. Since the second layer has three times as many blocks as the first layer, it has 1 * 3 = <<1*3=3>>3 blocks.\nTo find the number of blocks in the third layer, we multiply the number of blocks in the second layer by 3: 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 blocks.\nFinally, the number of blocks in the last (fourth) layer is 9 * 3 = <<9*3=27>>27 blocks.\nIn total, there are 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = <<1+3+9+27=40>>40 sandstone blocks in the pyramid.

He sold his $20,000 car for 80% of its value and then was able to haggle to buy a $30,000 sticker price car for 90% of its value.  How much was he out of pocket?\n\nHe got 20000*.8=$<<20000*.8=16000>>16,000\nHe was able to buy it for 30000*.9=$<<30000*.9=27000>>27,000\nSo he had to pay 27000-16000=$<<27000-16000=11000>>11,000 out of pocket. Answer: \\boxed{11,000}.\n\n\nQuestion: James gets paid $0.50/mile to drive a truck carrying hazardous waste. He has to pay $4.00/gallon for gas and his truck gets 20 miles per gallon. How much profit does he make from a 600 mile trip?\n\nJames will use 600 miles / 20 miles/gallon = <<600/20=30>>30 gallons of gas.\nHe will have to pay 30 gallons * $4.00/gallon = $<<30*4=120.00>>120.00 in gas.\nHe will make $0.50/mile * 600 miles = $<<0.50*600=300.00>>300.00 from driving.\nThus, his profit will be $300.00 - $120.00 = $<<300-120=180.00>>180.00.
