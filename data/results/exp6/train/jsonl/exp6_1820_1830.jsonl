When her father got home from work, he was upset that they did not put aside any chocolates for him. They felt bad, so they each gave up half of their chocolate bars for their father. Their father then gave 3 chocolate bars to their mother and ate 2. How many chocolate bars did Matilda's father have left?\n\nMatilda and her sisters each received 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 chocolate bars.\nThey gave half of their chocolate bars away for their father, so each gave up 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 chocolate bars.\nSince there were 5 of them, Matilda's father received 2 x 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 chocolate bars.\nHe gave 3 chocolate bars to their mom and ate 2, so he had 10 - 3 - 2 = <<10-3-2=5>>5 chocolate bars left.

Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar.  But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back.  His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies.  So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later.  The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.  How many cookies remained in the jar?\n\nLou Senior initially took 3 cookies out of the jar. After eating one and putting the other two back, he took a total of 4 cookies out of the jar. Louie Junior then took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. \nTherefore, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar is 4 + 7 = 11.\nIf Debra accused Lou Senior of eating half of the cookies, it means that there were originally 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 cookies in the jar. \nSince 11 cookies were taken out, there were 22 - 11 = <<22-11=11>>11 cookies remaining in the jar.
