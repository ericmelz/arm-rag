Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes?\n\nFirst, we need to find the discounted price for officers who have served at least a year. The discount is 20% of $85, which is (20/100) * $85 = $<<20/100*85=17>>17.\nSo the price after this discount is $85 - $17 = $<<85-17=68>>68.\nNow, we need to find the additional discount for officers who have served at least three years. 25% of $68 is (25/100) * $68 = $<<25/100*68=17>>17.\nSo the final price after the additional discount is $68 - $17 = $<<68-17=51>>51.

A 20% discount on $85 is (20/100) * $85 = $<<20/100*85=17>>17.\nThis means that the price after the first discount is $85 - $17 = $<<85-17=68>>68.\nNext, we need to calculate the additional discount that an officer who has served at least three years gets. A 25% discount on $68 is (25/100) * $68 = $<<25/100*68=17>>17.\nThis means that the officer only has to pay $68 - $17 = $<<68-17=51>>51 for the shoes.

How much does John save per year by splitting the apartment compared to living alone?\n\nHis old apartment cost 1200*.4=$<<1200*.4=480>>480 more than his old apartment\nSo his new apartment cost 1200+480=$<<1200+480=1680>>1680\nSo he pays 1680/3=$<<1680/3=560>>560 per month\nThat means he pays 1200-560=$<<1200-560=640>>640 less per month\nSo he saves 640*12=$<<640*12=7680>>7680. Answer: \\boxed{7680}.\n\n\nQuestion: John has 3 bedroom doors and two outside doors to replace.  The outside doors cost $20 each to replace and the bedroom doors are half that cost.  How much does he pay in total?\n", "text": "He needs to replace 2 outside doors, which cost $20 each, so the total cost of the outside doors is 2*20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.\nThe bedroom doors cost half the price of the outside doors, so they cost 20/2 = $<<20/2=10>>10 each.\nHe needs 3 bedroom doors, so the total cost of the bedroom doors is 3*10 = $<<3*10=30>>30.\nTherefore, he pays a total of 40+30 = $<<40+30=70>>70.
