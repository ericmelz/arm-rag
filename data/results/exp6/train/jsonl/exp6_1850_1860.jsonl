If there were 100 male adults, how many people attended the family reunion?\n\nSince there were 100 male adults, and 50 more female adults than male adults, then there were 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 female adults.\nThe total number of adults in the family reunion is 150+100 = <<150+100=250>>250\nThere were 2 children for every adult, a total of 2*250 = <<2*250=500>>500 children.\nIn the family reunion, there were a total of 500+250 = <<500+250=750>>750 people.

How many pages must she read the third week in order to finish the book?\n\nIn the first week she reads 600 / 2 = <<600/2=300>>300 pages.\nAfter the first week, there are 600 - 300 = <<600-300=300>>300 pages remaining.\nIn the second week she reads 300 x 30 / 100 = <<300*30/100=90>>90 pages.\nSo, the total number of pages that she needs to read in the third week is 300 - 90 = <<300-90=210>>210 pages.
