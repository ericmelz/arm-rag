How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?\n\nDanny drinks 90% of one bottle, so he has 100% - 90% = 10% of one bottle left.\nHe gives 70% of two bottles to his friends, so he keeps 100% - 70% = 30% of each of those bottles.\nTherefore, he has a total of 10% + 30% + 30% = <<10+30+30=70>>70% of a bottle left. Answer: \\boxed{70}.\n\n\nQuestion: Danny has 3 bottles of soda. He drinks 90% of one bottle and gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends. How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?\n\nDanny drinks 1 x 90/100 = <<1*90/100=0.9>>0.9 bottle of soda.\nHe gives away 2 x 70/100 = <<2*70/100=1.4>>1.4 bottles of soda to his friends.\nSo Danny is left with 3 - 0.9 - 1.4 = <<3-0.9-1.4=0.7>>0.7 bottle of soda.\nHence, Danny has 0.7/1 x 100 = <<0.7/1*100=70>>70% of a bottle left. Answer: \\boxed{70}.\n\n\nQuestion: Julio has four bottles of orange soda and seven bottles of grape soda in his fridge. His friend Mateo has a bottle of orange soda and 3 bottles of grape soda in his fridge. If the amount of beverage in each bottle is 2 liters, how many more liters of soda does Julio have?\n", "text": "Julio has a total of 4 bottles of orange + 7 bottles of grape = 11 bottles of soda.\nMateo has a total of 1 bottle of orange + 3 bottles of grape = 4 bottles of soda.\nThe difference in the number of bottles is 11 - 4 = 7 bottles of soda.\nThe difference in the number of liters of soda is 7 bottles of soda * 2 liters/bottle = 14 liters of soda.
