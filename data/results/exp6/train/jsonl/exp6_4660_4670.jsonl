Find the length of each of the equal pieces in millimeters.\n\nThe total length of the 100mm pieces is 100mm x 4 pieces = <<100*4=400>>400mm.\nThus, the length of the 1165 cm rope in mm is 1165 cm x 10 mm/cm = <<1165*10=11650>>11650 mm.\nThere were 400mm of 100mm pieces cut from the rope, so 11650 mm - 400 mm = <<11650-400=11250>>11250 mm is the length of the 154 - 4 = <<154-4=150>>150 equal pieces.\nHence, the length of each equal piece is 11250 mm / 150 pieces = <<11250/150=75>>75 mm.

How long is the shorter part?\n\nTo find the length of the shorter part, we need to find the length of both parts. \n\nLet's say the shorter part is 2x meters long. Then the longer part is 3x meters long. \n\nThe total length of the rope is 2x + 3x = 5x meters. \n\nWe know that the total length of the rope is 40 meters, so 5x = 40. \n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 5, we find that x = 8. \n\nTherefore, the shorter part is 2x = 2(8) = 16 meters long. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: A 1165 cm long rope is cut into 154 pieces. 150 of the pieces are equally sized and the remaining pieces are 100mm each. Find the length of each of the equal pieces in millimeters.\n\nThe total length of the rope in millimeters is $1165\\text{ cm} \\times \\frac{10\\text{ mm}}{\\text{cm}} = 11650 \\text{ mm}$.  The 150 equal-sized pieces account for $150x$ millimeters.  The total length of the remaining pieces is $100(154 - 150) = 400$ millimeters.  We have $$150x + 400 = 11650.$$ Subtracting 400 we have $150x = 11250$, and dividing by 150 we have $x = \\boxed{75}$.\n\n\nQuestion: A 40 meters rope was cut into 2 parts in the ratio of 2:3. How long is the shorter part?\n\nThe total ratio is 2 + 3 = 5.\nLet x be the length of the shorter part of the rope.\nThe longer part of the rope is 3/5 * 40 = 24 meters long.\nSo, the shorter part of the rope is x = 40 - 24 = <<40-24=16>>16 meters long.

Find the length of each of the equal pieces in millimeters.\n", "text": "The total length of the rope is 1165 cm. Since there are 100 centimeters in a meter and 10 millimeters in a centimeter, the total length of the rope is 1165 * 10 = <<1165*10=11650>>11650 millimeters.\n\nOut of the 154 pieces, 150 are equally sized. Let's say the length of each equal piece is x millimeters. Therefore, the total length of these 150 equal pieces is 150 * x = 150x millimeters.\n\nThe remaining 4 pieces are each 100mm long. So the total length of these 4 pieces is 4 * 100 = 400 millimeters.\n\nSince the total length of the rope is the sum of the length of the equal pieces and the length of the remaining pieces, we can set up the equation:\n\n11650 = 150x + 400\n\nSubtracting 400 from both sides, we get:\n\n11250 = 150x\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by 150, we find:\n\nx = 75\n\nTherefore, each of the equal pieces has a length of 75 millimeters.
