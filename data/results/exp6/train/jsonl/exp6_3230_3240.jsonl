If Nancy has 1920 grams of jade, how much more money will she make turning it all into elephants instead of giraffes?\n", "text": "To find the answer, we need to compare the amount of money Nancy will make carving giraffes to the amount of money she will make carving elephants. \n\nFirst, let's find out how many giraffes she can carve with 1920 grams of jade. Since each giraffe statue takes 120 grams of jade, we can divide 1920 by 120 to get the number of giraffes: 1920 / 120 = 16 giraffes.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money she will make carving giraffes. Each giraffe sells for $150, so if she carves 16 giraffes, she will earn 16 * 150 = $2400.\n\nNow, let's find out how many elephants she can carve. Since each elephant statue takes twice as much jade as a giraffe, it will take 120 * 2 = 240 grams of jade per elephant. So, she can carve 1920 / 240 = 8 elephants.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money she will make carving elephants. Each elephant sells for $350, so if she carves 8 elephants, she will earn 8 * 350 = $2800.\n\nTo find the difference in money she will make turning all the jade into elephants instead of giraffes, we subtract the amount from carving giraffes from the amount from carving elephants: $2800 - $2400 = $400.\n\nTherefore, Nancy will make $400 more by turning all the jade into elephants instead of giraffes.
