The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers\u2019 scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers\u2019 scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the weight of each plate in pounds. A pound is equal to 16 ounces, so 10 ounces is equal to 10/16 = 5/8 pounds.\nNext, we need to determine how much weight was in the box originally. Since each plate weighs 5/8 pounds, the weight of 38 plates is 5/8 * 38 = <<5/8*38=23.75>>23.75 pounds.\nTo find out how many plates Hasan needs to remove, we need to determine how much weight remains in the box after removing one plate each time. The weight limit for the box is 20 pounds, so Hasan needs to remove 23.75 - 20 = 3.75 pounds.\nSince each plate weighs 5/8 pounds, Hasan needs to remove 3.75 / (5/8) = 3.75 * (8/5) = 6 plates from the shipping box.

How much will her order be with the discount?\n\nShe is ordering 2 quiches at $15.00 each so 2*15 = $30.00\nShe is ordering 6 croissants at $3.00 each so 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00\nShe is ordering 6 sausage biscuits at $2.00 each so 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00\nAll total her order comes to 30+18+12 = $<<30+18+12=60.00>>60.00\nShe gets 10% off so .10*60 = $<<.10*60=6.00>>6.00 discount off her order\nHer order is $60.00 and she gets a $6.00 discount so 60-6 = $<<60-6=54.00>>54.00.

How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?\n\nIn 6 months, the store uses 90 kilograms of grapes, so in a year, it will use 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 kilograms of grapes.\nIf the store increases its production by twenty percent, it will need an additional 20/100 * 180 = <<20/100*180=36>>36 kilograms of grapes.\nThe total amount of grapes the store needs in a year after increasing its production is 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216.

How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?\n\nBorris currently uses 90/6 = 15 kilograms of grapes per month.\nAfter increasing production by twenty percent, he will need an additional 15 x 0.20 = <<15*0.20=3>>3 kilograms of grapes per month.\nTherefore, he will need a total of 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18 kilograms of grapes per month.\nSo, he will need 18 x 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.
