How many times did Max win?\n\nIf the ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins is 8:3, then the total ratio of wins is 8+3= <<8+3=11>>11.\nIf Chloe won 24 times, then 8 units of the total ratio are equal to 24, and each unit is equal to 24/8= <<24/8=3>>3.\nTherefore, Max won 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 times. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Chloe and Max played Mario Kart together. The ratio of Chloe\u2019s wins to Max\u2019s wins is 8:3. Chloe won 24 times. How many times did Max win?\n\nIf the ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins is 8:3, and Chloe won 24 times, then the total number of wins by both Chloe and Max is 8+3=<<8+3=11>>11\nThe fraction representing Chloe's wins is 8/11, so if Chloe won 24 times, Max won 3/8*24=<<3/8*24=9>>9 times. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Chloe and Max played Mario Kart together. The ratio of Chloe\u2019s wins to Max\u2019s wins is 8:3. Chloe won 24 times. How many times did Max win?\n\nIf the ratio of Chloe's wins to Max's wins is 8:3, then the total ratio representing wins is 8+3 = <<8+3=11>>11\nIf Chloe won 24 times, a win represents 24/8 = <<24/8=3>>3 wins.\nMax won 3*3 = <<3*3=9>>9 times. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Chloe and Max played Mario Kart together. The ratio of Chloe\u2019s wins to Max\u2019s wins is 8:3. Chloe won 24 times. How many times did Max win?\n\nLet C be the number of wins Chloe had and M be the number of wins Max had. We know that C/M = 8/3 and C = 24.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 24/M = 8/3.\nCross multiplying, we get 3 * 24 = 8M.\nDividing both sides by 8, we get 72 = M. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Chloe and Max played Mario Kart together. The ratio of Chloe\u2019s wins to Max\u2019s wins is 8:3. Chloe won 24 times. How many times did Max win?\n", "text": "If Chloe's wins to Max's wins is in the ratio 8:3, we can set up a proportion.\nLet x be the number of times Max won.\nWe can set up the proportion: 8/3 = 24/x\nCross multiplying, we get 8x = 72\nDividing both sides by 8, we get x = 9\nTherefore, Max won 9 times. Answer: \\boxed{9}."}
