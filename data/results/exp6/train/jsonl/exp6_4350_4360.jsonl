How many people remained to see the end of the game if there were 240 girls at the beginning of the game?\n\nIf the number of girls at the beginning of the game was 240, the number of boys was 600-240 = <<600-240=360>>360.\nWhen one-eighth of the girls left before the game ended, the number that remained is 240-240/8 = <<240-240/8=210>>210 girls.\nOne-fourth of the number of boys left early, a total of 1/4*360 = <<1/4*360=90>>90 boys.\nThe number of boys that remained is 360-90= <<360-90=270>>270\nIn total, the number of people who remained in the stadium to see the end of the game is 210+270 = <<210+270=480>>480.

How many hours does Steve spend with his family in a day?\n\nFirst, we need to find a common denominator for 1/3, 1/6, and 1/12. The least common multiple of 3, 6, and 12 is 12.\nSo if Steve's day has 12 parts, then Steve spends 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 parts sleeping.\nHe spends 1/6 * 12 = <<1/6*12=2>>2 parts in school.\nHe spends 1/12 * 12 = <<1/12*12=1>>1 part making assignments.\nSo he spends a total of 4 + 2 + 1 = <<4+2+1=7>>7 parts of his day doing something other than being with his family.\nSince his day has 12 parts, Steve spends 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 parts with his family.\nTherefore, Steve spends 5 * (24 / 12) = <<5*(24/12)=10>>10 hours with his family in a day. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Steve spends 1/3 of the day sleeping, 1/6 of the day in school, 1/12 of the day making assignments, and the rest of the day with his family. How many hours does Steve spend with his family in a day?\n\nThe fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12).\n\nTo simplify the last fraction, we need to find the least common multiple of 3, 6, and 12.\n\n3 = 3 \u00d7 1,\n6 = 3 \u00d7 2,\n12 = 3 \u00d7 4.\n\nThe least common multiple is 3 \u00d7 4 = <<3*4=12>>12.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12) = (12/12 - 4/12 - 2/12 - 1/12) = 5/12.\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, Steve spends (5/12) \u00d7 24 = <<(5/12)*24=10>>10 hours with his family.
