Each floor of Lucas' house has 3 windows; Lucas lives in a 3-story house. To get Lucas to finish the job faster, his father tells him that he will subtract $1 for every 3 days that pass without Lucas finishing the job. In 6 days, Lucas finishes cleaning all the windows in the house. How much will his father pay him, in dollars?\n\nLucas' father says that he will subtract $1 for every three days that pass without Lucas finishing the job. Therefore, Lucas' father will subtract $1 every 3 days. Since Lucas cleans the windows in 6 days, Lucas' father will subtract $1 * 2 = $<<1*2=2>>2 from what he would have paid Lucas.\nTo find out how much money Lucas' father would have paid him if he were not subtracting money from his final payment, we first need to find out how many windows Lucas has cleaned. Lucas cleans three floors of windows in his house, so he cleans 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 windows.\nLucas should have been paid $2 * 9 = $<<2*9=18>>18, but he's losing $2 because he took 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 times 1$.\nSo Lucas gets 18 - 2 = $<<18-2=16>>16.

In 6 days, Lucas finishes cleaning all the windows in the house. How much will his father pay him, in dollars?\n\nThere are 3 floors * 3 windows/floor = <<3*3=9>>9 windows in the house.\nIn 6 days, Lucas loses 6 days / 3 days/lost = <<6/3=2>>2 dollars for taking too long.\nSo his father will pay him 9 windows * $2/window - $2 lost = $<<9*2-2=16>>16.

In 6 days, Lucas finishes cleaning all the windows in the house. How much will his father pay him, in dollars?\n\nLucas cleans 3 windows/floor * 3 floors = <<3*3=9>>9 windows in his house.\nLucas took 6 days to clean the windows, so his father will deduct 6 days / 3 days = $<<6/3=2>>2 from his pay.\nFor the cleaning, his father will award him $2/window * 9 windows - $2 = $<<2*9-2=16>>16. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lucas' father offers to pay him $2 for each window in the house that he cleans. Each floor of Lucas' house has 3 windows; Lucas lives in a 3-story house.

In 6 days, Lucas finishes cleaning all the windows in the house. How much will his father pay him, in dollars?\n\nLucas cleans 3 windows/floor x 3 floors = <<3*3=9>>9 windows.\nHis father will pay him $2/window x 9 windows = $<<2*9=18>>18.\nHis father will subtract $1 from the total if 3 days pass, so up to 6 days, his father would subtract $1 x 2 = $<<1*2=2>>2 from the $18.\nSo Lucas' father will finally pay him $18 - $2 = $<<18-2=16>>16.

He sold the remaining 300 face masks in baggies at the rate of 10 pieces of mask for $3. How much profit did he make?\n", "text": "The face masks cost Owen 12 x $9 = $108.\nHe repacked 6 x 50 = 300 face masks.\nSo, he was able to repackage them into 300/25 = 12 sets.\nThe sold repacked face masks amounted to 12 sets x $5/set = $60.\nHe was able to sell 300/10 x $3 = $90 in face masks.\nTherefore Owen was able to make a total of $60 + $90 = $150.\nThus, Owen made a profit of $150 - $108 = $42.
