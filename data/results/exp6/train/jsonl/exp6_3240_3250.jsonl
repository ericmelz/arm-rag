How many iron balls have been molded?\n", "text": "The volume of one iron bar is 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm = <<12*8*6=576>>576 cubic cm. \nSince there are 10 iron bars, the total volume is 576 cubic cm x 10 = <<576*10=5760>>5760 cubic cm. \nTherefore, the number of iron balls molded is 5760 cubic cm / 8 cubic cm/ball = <<5760/8=720>>720 iron balls. Answer: \\boxed{720}."}

After that it takes him 50% longer than that to heal from the skin graft.  How long did he take to recover from everything?\n\nIt takes James 4 weeks to heal after the accident.\nHe takes 50% longer to heal from the skin graft, so it takes him an additional 4 * 0.50 = <<4*0.50=2>>2 weeks.\nTherefore, it takes him a total of 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 weeks to heal from the skin graft.\nThus, it takes James a total of 4 + 6 = <<4+6=10>>10 weeks to recover from everything.

After that it takes him 50% longer than that to heal from the skin graft.  How long did he take to recover from everything?\n\nHe healed enough in 4 weeks and it took him 50% longer to heal from the skin graft so it took him 4*.50 = <<4*.50=2>>2 weeks longer to heal from the graft\nThe graft took 2 weeks longer to heal so it took him 4+2 = <<4+2=6>>6 weeks to heal from the graft\nIt takes 4 weeks to heal and 6 weeks from the skin graft so the total time to heal is 4+6 = <<4+6=10>>10 weeks. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: James hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?\n\nThe injury would take 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 days to fully heal.\nHe then wants to wait an additional 3 days, so in total, he needs to wait 15 + 3 = <<15+3=18>>18 days.\nHe then wants to wait an additional 3 weeks, which is 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 days.\nIn total, he needs to wait 18 + 21 = <<18+21=39>>39 days.
