After downloading 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. How many valuable files was he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round?\n", "text": "Brennan deleted 70/100*800 = 560 files from the first 800 he downloaded.\nAfter deleting the unrelated files, the number of files left is 800-560 = 240\nWhen he downloaded 400 more files, the number of files he had became 240+400 = 640\nAfter deleting 3/5 of the irrelevant files, he remained with 3/5*400 = 240\nThe total number of valuable files he was left with is 640-240 = 400.

If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?\n\nThe first four houses have a total of 4 houses * 3 gnomes = <<4*3=12>>12 gnomes.\nSo, the fifth house has 20 total gnomes - 12 = <<20-12=8>>8 gnomes.

If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?\n", "text": "Let's solve this problem step by step. \n\nFirst, we find the total number of gnomes in the first four houses. Since each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, the total number of gnomes in the first four houses is 4 houses * 3 gnomes/house = 12 gnomes.\n\nNext, we subtract the total number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes on the street to find the number of gnomes in the fifth house. So, the fifth house has a total of 20 gnomes - 12 gnomes = 8 gnomes.\n\nTherefore, the fifth house has 8 gnomes. Answer: \\boxed{8}."}

How much was her previous monthly income?\n\nLet X be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.\nHer rent and utilities used to amount to 40/100 * X.\nHer rent and utilities now amount to 25/100 * (X + 600) = (25/100) * X + (25/100) * 600 = 1/4 * X + 1/4 * 600\nSo we have 40/100 * X = 1/4 * X + 1/4 * 600\nMultiplying both sides by 100/4 gives us 10 * X = 25 * X + 25 * 600\nMultiplying both sides by 4 gives us 40 * X = 100 * X + 100 * 600\nSubtracting 100 * X from both sides gives us -60 * X = 100 * 600\nDividing both sides by -60 gives us X = -100 * 600 / 60 = -100 * 10 = -1000\nThus Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $<<1000=1000>>1000.

Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?\n\nLet X be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income.\nMrs. Snyder's rent and utilities cost her 0.4*X.\nMrs. Snyder's new monthly income is X + $600.\nMrs. Snyder's new monthly rent and utilities cost her 0.25 * (X + $600).\nThus, we get 0.4*X = 0.25 * (X + $600).\nThus, we get 0.4*X = 0.25 * X + $150.\nThus, we get 0.15 * X = $150.\nThus, X = $150 / 0.15 = $<<150/0.15=1000>>1000.

His house rental is $640 each month; his monthly food expense is $380; his electric and water bill costs 1/4 of what he makes, and his insurances cost 1/5 of what he makes. How much money does he have left after paying those four bills?\n\nDr. Jones' total monthly expenses are $640 + $380 + ($6,000/4) + ($6,000/5) = $640 + $380 + $1,500 + $1,200 = $<<640+380+1500+1200=3720>>3720.\nTherefore, Dr. Jones has $6,000 - $3,720 = $<<6000-3720=2280>>2280 left after paying those four bills.

This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?\n\nKristy's total earnings for the month from her basic salary would be 160 hours * $7.50/hour = $<<160*7.5=1200>>1200.\nShe earned a commission of 16/100 * $25000 = $<<16/100*25000=4000>>4000 from sales.\nHer total monthly earnings were $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=5200>>5200.\nKristy's monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills, and savings is 95/100 * $5200 = $<<95/100*5200=4940>>4940.\nShe allocated $5200 - $4940 = $<<5200-4940=260>>260 to insurance.

His monthly bills include $1250 for rent, $150 on utilities, $400 into retirement & savings accounts, $300.00 on groceries/eating out, $200 for insurance and $200 for miscellaneous expenses.  If he\u2019s looking at buying a car with a monthly car payment of $350 how much does that leave for gas and maintenance?\n\nThe total of all the bills Kyle pays every month is $1250+$150+$400+$300+$200+$200 = $<<1250+150+400+300+200+200=2500>>2500.00\nWhen you subtract that number from his monthly salary his monthly budget is 3200-2500 = $<<3200-2500=700>>700.\nSince he will spend 350.00 a month on a car payment that leaves him with 700-350 = $<<700-350=350>>350 for gas and maintenance.
