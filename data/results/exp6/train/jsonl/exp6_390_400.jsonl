He plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches a 20-mile run. How many weeks before the marathon should he start training if he has already run 2 miles?\n\nTo reach a 20-mile run, Oscar needs to add 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 miles to his training.\nSince he plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week, he will need a total of 18 / (2/3) = <<18/(2/3)=27>>27 weeks to reach his goal.

How many weeks before the marathon should he start training if he has already run 2 miles?\n\nOscar wants to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches a 20-mile run, which means he will run an additional 2/3 miles per week.\nLet's first find out how many additional miles Oscar needs to run to reach a 20-mile run: 20 miles - 2 miles = <<20-2=18>>18 miles\nNow we divide the number of additional miles that Oscar needs to run by the number of additional miles he runs every week: 18 miles / (2/3 mile/week) = 27 weeks.

How many weeks before the marathon should he start training if he has already run 2 miles?\n\nOscar wants to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches a 20-mile run. To find the number of weeks he needs to train, we need to find the distance he needs to add. The distance Oscar needs to add is 20 miles - 2 miles = <<20-2=18>>18 miles.\nHe plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week. So, the number of weeks he needs to train is 18 miles / (2/3 mile/week) = <<18/(2/3)=27>>27 weeks. Answer: \\boxed{27}.\n\n\nQuestion: Oscar wants to train for a marathon. He plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches a 20-mile run. How many weeks before the marathon should he start training if he has already run 2 miles?\n\nOscar wants to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches 20 miles. To find out how many weeks this will take, we first need to find how many miles Oscar needs to add in total. This can be found by subtracting the distance he has already run, 2 miles, from the total distance of the marathon, 20 miles: 20 miles - 2 miles = <<20-2=18>>18 miles\nNext, we divide the total number of miles Oscar needs to add, 18 miles, by the number of miles he adds each week, 2/3 of a mile: 18 miles / (2/3) miles/week = (18 miles) * (3/2 miles/week/mile) = 27 weeks.

How many miles does he run a week?\n\nHe runs 5*1.5=<<5*1.5=7.5>>7.5 hours a week\nHe runs at a speed of 8 mph so he runs 7.5*8=<<7.5*8=60>>60 miles a week. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: Oscar wants to train for a marathon. He plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week until he reaches a 20-mile run. How many weeks before the marathon should he start training if he has already run 2 miles?\n", "text": "To find the number of weeks Oscar needs to train, we must first calculate the number of miles he needs to add. He plans to add 2/3 of a mile each week, so the number of additional miles needed is 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 miles. \n\nTo determine the number of weeks, we divide the number of additional miles by the additional miles per week: 18 miles / (2/3 mile/week) = 18 * (3/2) = <<18*(3/2)=27>>27 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Oscar should start training 27 weeks before the marathon.

The next morning, there was a 4-hour elephant exodus out of the park, at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants/hour. Over the next 7-hour period, new elephants entered the park at a constant rate. If the final number of elephants in the park was 28,980, at what rate did the new elephants enter the park?\n", "text": "During the 4-hour exodus, a total of 4 hours * 2,880 elephants/hour = 11,520 elephants left the park.\nSo, after the exodus, the number of elephants in the park was 30,000 \u2013 11,520 = 18,480 elephants.\nLet X be the rate at which new elephants entered the park.\nThe number of new elephants that entered the park over the 7-hour period is 7 hours * X elephants/hour = 7X elephants.\nThe final number of elephants in the park was 18,480 + 7X = 28,980.\nThus, the rate at which new elephants entered the park is X = (28,980 \u2013 18,480) / 7 = 1,500 elephants/hour. Answer: \\boxed{1500}."}

The remaining friends split the cost equally among themselves. If each share is now $8 more, how much does the gift cost, in dollars?\n\nLet X be the cost of the gift.\nSo, each share of the gift costs X/10 dollars.\nAfter four friends drop out, the cost of the gift is shared among 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 people.\nTherefore, each share of the gift now costs X/6 dollars.\nSince each share is now $8 more, then X/6 - X/10 = $8.\nBy getting the least common denominator, we can simplify the left side of the equation to (10X - 6X)/60 = $8.\nCombining like terms simplifies the left side of the equation to 4X/60 = $8.\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 60/4 to get X = $8 x 60/4 = $<<8*60/4=120>>120.

He can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many widgets Sam assembles in 6 hours of work. Each widget takes 10 minutes, so in 6 hours, Sam can make 6*60/10= <<6*60/10=36>>36 widgets.\nJack is only able to help for 4 hours, so in that time he can assemble 4*60/15=<<4*60/15=16>>16 complete widgets.\nTogether, Sam and Jack assembled 36+16= <<36+16=52>>52 widgets.\nThis means that Tony assembled 68-52 = <<68-52=16>>16 widgets on his own.\nTony worked the entire 8-hour shift, so he made 16 widgets in 8*60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes.\nTo find how long it takes Tony to assemble one widget, we divide the total time Tony worked by the number of widgets he assembled: 480/16 = <<480/16=30>>30 minutes.

At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many widgets Sam can assemble in a day. Sam works for 6 hours, or 6*60 = <<6*60=360>>360 minutes.\nTherefore, Sam can assemble 360 / 10 = <<360/10=36>>36 widgets in a day.\nJack helps to assemble widgets for 4 hours, or 4*60 = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes.\nTherefore, Jack can assemble 240 / 15 = <<240/15=16>>16 widgets in a day.\nTo find out how many widgets Tony can assemble, we have to subtract Sam and Jack's daily production from the total production. Tony therefore assembles 68 - 36 - 16 = <<68-36-16=16>>16 widgets in a day.\nAs Tony works for 8 hours, he can assemble a widget in 8*60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes.\nTherefore, it takes Tony 480 / 16 = 30 minutes to assemble a widget.
