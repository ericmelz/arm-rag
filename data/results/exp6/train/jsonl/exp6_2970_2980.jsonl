Betsy can jump rope half as long as Cindy before tripping up, while Tina can jump three times as long as Betsy.  How many more minutes can Tina jump rope than Cindy?\n", "text": "If Cindy can jump rope for 12 minutes and Betsy can jump half as long as Cindy, then Betsy can jump rope for 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 minutes. Since Tina can jump three times as long as Betsy, Tina can jump rope for 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 minutes. Therefore, Tina can jump rope for 18-12 = <<18-12=6>>6 more minutes than Cindy. Answer: \\boxed{6}."}
