If records show that the home team has won three matches, and each team drew four matches and lost none, how many matches have both teams played in total?\n\nIf the rival team has won twice as many matches as the home team did, with three wins for the home team, the rival team has won 3 matches * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 matches.\nIn total, in terms of performance, both teams managed to win 6 matches + 3 matches = <<6+3=9>>9 matches.\nSince both teams drew four games each, they drew 4 matches * 2 teams = <<4*2=8>>8 matches combined.\nBoth teams have lost no matches, so in total, they have played 9 matches won + 8 matches drawn + 0 matches lost = <<9+8+0=17>>17 matches.

Joe and his team won 1 game and drew 3. The first-place team has won 2 games and tied 2. By how many points did the first-place team beat Joe's team?\n\nThe total point of Joe's team from their 1 win and 3 draws is 1*3 + 3*1 = <<1*3+3*1=6>>6 points.\nThe first-place team gets 2*3 + 2*1 = <<2*3+2*1=8>>8 points from their 2 wins and 2 draws.\nThus, the first-place team has beaten Joe's team by 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 points. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: At the end of the first quarter, the winning team had double the points of the losing team. At the end of the second quarter, the winning team had 10 more points than it started with. At the end of the third quarter, the winning team had 20 more points than the number it had in the second quarter. If the total points the winning team scored in the game was 80, and the losing team had 10 points in the first quarter, calculate the total number of points the team scored in the fourth quarter.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the winning team had double the points of the losing team, meaning they had 2*10= <<2*10=20>>20 points.\nAt the end of the second quarter, the winning team had 10 more points than it started with, meaning they had 20+10= <<20+10=30>>30 points.\nAt the end of the third quarter, the winning team had 20 more points than the number it had in the second quarter, meaning they had 30+20= <<20+30=50>>50 points.\nIf the total points the winning team scored in the game was 80, and they scored 50 points at the end of the third quarter, they scored 80-50= <<80-50=30>>30 points in the fourth quarter.

If you are six in the family and agreed to pay equally for the cost, how much will each of your family members pay?\n\nThere are 5 dozens of people attending the family reunion so that's 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 people.\nEach person can consume 2 cans of soda so 60 x 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 cans of soda needed.\nEach box contains 10 cans of soda so that's a need for 120/10 = <<120/10=12>>12 boxes of soda.\nEach box of soda costs $2 so 12 boxes cost 12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.\nThere are 6 people in your family so you will have to pay 24 / 6 = $<<24/6=4>>4 each.

It was assumed that each person can consume 2 cans of soda. If you are six in the family and agreed to pay equally for the cost, how much will each of your family members pay?\n\nThere are five dozens of people which is equal to 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 people.\nIf each person can consume 2 cans of soda, then you will need 60 x 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 cans of soda.\nSince a box of soda contains 10 cans, then you will need 120/10 = <<120/10=12>>12 boxes of soda.\nSo each of your family members will pay $2 x 12 = $<<2*12=24>>24.\nTherefore, each of your family members will pay $24/6 = $<<24/6=4>>4.
