He can run a mile in 12 minutes. He watches two movies, which are an average length of 1.5 hours. How many miles does he run?\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so each movie is 1.5 * 60 = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes.\nHe watches a total of 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 minutes of movies.\nHe can run a mile in 12 minutes, so he runs 180 / 12 = <<180/12=15>>15 miles.

How many miles does he run?\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, the movies are 1.5 x 60 = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes long each.\nSo, the total amount of time he spent watching them is 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 minutes.\nThus, he can run for 180/12 = <<180/12=15>>15 miles.

In minutes, how much faster will Mac run a 24 mile race?\n\nTo find out how much faster Mac will run a 24 mile race, we need to calculate the difference in their speeds. \n\nApple's speed is 3 miles per hour, which means she will take (24 / 3) = 8 hours to complete the race.\nMac's speed is 4 miles per hour, which means he will take (24 / 4) = 6 hours to complete the race.\n\nThe difference in their times is 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 hours.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, Mac will run the race 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes faster.

If the cashier gives her the smallest number of coins possible as change, how many coins will Rosie get as change?\n\nRosie will get 56 cents in change because 100 - 44 = <<100-44=56>>56\nShe will get 2 quarters because 56 / 25 = <<56/25=2.24>>2.24\nShe will get 50 cents in quarters because 2 x 25 = <<2*25=50>>50\nShe has 6 cents left because 56 - 50 = <<56-50=6>>6\nShe will get 1 nickel because 6 / 5 = <<6/5=1.2>>1.2\nShe has 1 cent left because 6 - 5 = <<6-5=1>>1\nShe will get 1 penny because 1 / 1 = 1.\nShe will get 3 coins in change because 2 + 1 + 1 = <<2+1+1=4>>4. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: Rosie pays for a $.44 piece of candy with a $1 bill. If the cashier gives her the smallest number of coins possible as change, how many coins will Rosie get as change?\n\nSince Rosie paid with a $1 bill, she will get $1 - $0.44 = $<<1-0.44=0.56>>0.56 in change.\nSince there are 100 cents in $1, Rosie will get 0.56 x 100 = <<0.56*100=56>>56 cents in change.\nSince there are 25 cents in a quarter, Rosie will get 56 / 25 = <<56/25=2.24>>2.24 quarters.\nRosie will get 2 quarters as change.\nSince there are 10 cents in a dime, 56 - (2 * 25) = 6 cents will remain after Rosie gets her quarters.\nRosie will get 1 nickel as change.\nSince there are 5 cents in a nickel, 6 - 5 = <<6-5=1>>1 cent will remain after Rosie gets her nickel.\nRosie will get 1 penny as change.\nRosie will get a total of 2 + 1 + 1 = <<2+1+1=4>>4 coins as change. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?\n\nIn another three years, the art piece will be 3 * 4000 = $<<3*4000=12000>>12000.\nThus, the art piece will have increased by 12000 - 4000 = $<<12000-4000=8000>>8000. Answer: \\boxed{8000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years.

If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\n\nWe can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nIn the morning, Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance he travels is 30 miles.\n\nIn the evening, he takes 1.5 hours to drive back home. Since the morning and evening traffic is similar, we can assume that the distance is the same, 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance for the return journey is also 30 miles.\n\nThe total time for the return journey is 1.5 hours.\n\nThus, the average speed of the return journey is 30 miles / 1.5 hours = <<30/1.5=20>>20 mph.
