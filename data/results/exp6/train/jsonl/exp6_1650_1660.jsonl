She made 150 cookies so her 15 neighbors could get 10 cookies each. However, the neighbor who arrived last told Edna there were only 8 cookies left. Edna thinks it was Sarah who took too many cookies. If all the other neighbors took the correct amount of cookies, how many cookies did Sarah take?\n\nSarah took 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 cookies too many.\nTherefore, Sarah took 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12 cookies.

How many cookies did he put in the fridge if he gave twice as many cookies as he gave Tim to Anna?\n\nSince he gave Tim 15 cookies, Anna received 2 * 15 cookies = <<2*15=30>>30 cookies.\nIn total, Uncle Jude gave 15 cookies + 23 cookies + 30 cookies = <<15+23+30=68>>68 cookies.\nSo he put 256 cookies - 68 cookies = <<256-68=188>>188 cookies in the fridge.

Matt got twice as many apples, and Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. How many fruits do the three children have in total?\n\nMike received 3 oranges.\nMatt received twice as many apples as Mike, so he had 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 apples\nAltogether Mike and Matt got 3 + 6 = <<3+6=9>>9 fruits.\nAnd Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether, so he had 9 bananas.\nSo altogether the children received 3 oranges + 6 apples + 9 bananas = <<3+6+9=18>>18 fruits.

Of the remaining brownies, she gave half to her best friend, Carl, and another two to her friend, Simon.  How many brownies did she have left?\n\nAnnie gave the school administrator 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 brownies.\nThis means she had 20 - 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 brownies left.\nShe gave Carl half of those 10 brownies, so Carl received 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 brownies.\nThis means she had 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 brownies left.\nShe then gave Simon 2 brownies, meaning she had 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 brownies left.

In x years, Beth will be 18 + x years old and her little sister will be 5 + x years old.\nTo find the number of years in which Beth will be twice her sister's age, the equation is: 18 + x = 2(5 + x).\nSimplifying the equation, we get 18 + x = 10 + 2x.\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get 18 = 10 + x.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8 = x.\nTherefore, in 8 years, Beth will be twice her sister's age.
