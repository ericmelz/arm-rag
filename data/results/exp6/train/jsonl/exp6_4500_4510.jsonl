Since Jean is wanted on 3 counts of arson and each count carries a 36-month sentence, the total sentence for the arson charges is 3 counts * 36 months/count = 108 months.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total sentence for the burglary charges. Jean is wanted on 2 burglary charges and each charge carries an 18-month sentence, so the total sentence for the burglary charges is 2 charges * 18 months/charge = 36 months.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total sentence for the petty larceny charges. Jean is wanted on six times as many petty larceny charges as burglary charges, so there are 2 burglary charges * 6 petty larceny charges/burglary charge = 12 petty larceny charges. Each petty larceny charge is 1/3rd as long as a burglary charge, so each charge carries a sentence of 18 months/charge / 3 = 6 months/charge. Therefore, the total sentence for the petty larceny charges is 12 charges * 6 months/charge = 72 months.\n\nTo find the total sentence for all the charges, we add the sentence for each type of charge: 108 months + 36 months + 72 months = 216 months.\n\nTherefore, Jean is facing a total of 216 months in jail.

If the video gets 1000 more dislikes and 0 more likes how many dislikes does the video have?\n\nIf the YouTube video got 3000 likes and 100 more than half as many dislikes, the number of dislikes is (3000 likes / 2) + 100 = 1500 + 100 = <<3000/2+100=1600>>1600 dislikes.\nWhen the video gets 1000 more dislikes, the total number of dislikes becomes 1600 + 1000 = <<1600+1000=2600>>2600 dislikes.

She uploaded videos halfway through June,  at that pace,  and then doubled the number of video hours she uploaded on the remaining days. What's the total number of video hours she has uploaded at the end of the month?\n\nThere are 30 days in June, so halfway through the month is 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 days.\nIf she uploaded 10 one-hour videos each day for 15 days, the total number of videos she uploaded is 10 videos/day * 15 days = <<10*15=150>>150 videos.\nThe total number of hours for those videos is 150 videos * 1 hour/video = <<150*1=150>>150 hours.\nIf she doubled the number of video hours she uploaded on the remaining days which is 30-15 = <<30-15=15>>15 days,\nthen she uploaded 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 hours of videos each day on the remaining days.\nIf she uploaded videos for 15 days and had 20 hours/day, the total number of hours for the videos she uploaded on the remaining days is 15 days * 20 hours/day = <<15*20=300>>300 hours.\nThe total number of video hours she has uploaded at the end of the month is 300 hours + 150 hours = <<300+150=450>>450 hours.
