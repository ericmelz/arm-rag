If he drives at 40 miles per hour and follows the exact same route as Yolanda, how many minutes will it take him to catch her?\n\nSince Yolanda leaves home 15 minutes before her husband, and Yolanda's speed is 20 mph, she has a head-start of 20 * 15 = <<20*15=300>>300 miles.\nHer husband gains on her at a rate of 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 mph.\nSo to catch up, it will take her husband 300 / 20 = <<300/20=15>>15 minutes.

She rode her bicycle slowly to the high school, rode four miles around the running track at her faster, race pace, and then rode back home, slowly, on the same route. If her total mileage was 10 miles, how far is it, in miles, from Layla's house to the high school?\n\nLet S be the number of miles Layla rode slowly from her house to the high school.\nThus, Layla rode her bicycle from her house to the high school and back, a total of S + S = 2S miles.\nThus, Layla rode a total of 2S + 4 = 10 miles.\nThus, 2S = 6.\nTherefore, the distance from Layla's house to the high school is S = 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 miles.

During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.
