Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?\n\nLet's break down how much each person will eat:\n- Aaron will not eat lasagna.\n- Manny will eat 1 piece.\n- Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 pieces.\n- Raphael will eat half as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 0.5 = <<1*0.5=0.5>>0.5 pieces.\n- Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any leftovers from Raphael, which is 0.5 pieces.\n- So Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 = <<2+0.5=2.5>>2.5 pieces.\n\nAdding up the individual amounts, in total, Manny should cut his lasagna into 0 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 = <<0+1+2+0.5+2.5=6>>6 pieces.

If each person could have taken one or more drinks regardless of what was reported, how many people altogether were at the gathering?\n\nTo find the total number of people at the gathering, we can add the number of people who took wine (26), the number of people who took soda (22), and then subtract the number of people who took both drinks (17).\n\n26 + 22 - 17 = <<26+22-17=31>>31\n\nTherefore, there were 31 people altogether at the gathering.

If each person could have taken one or more drinks regardless of what was reported, how many people altogether were at the gathering?\n\nTo find the total number of people at the gathering, we need to add the number of people who took wine, the number of people who took soda, and then subtract the number of people who took both drinks, as they are counted twice. \n\nSo, the total number of people is 26 + 22 - 17 = <<26+22-17=31>>31. \n\nTherefore, there were 31 people altogether at the gathering. Answer: \\boxed{31}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a gathering, it was reported that 26 people took wine, 22 people took soda, and 17 people took both drinks. If each person could have taken one or more drinks regardless of what was reported, how many people altogether were at the gathering?\n\nLet's calculate the total number of people who took either wine or soda by summing the number of people who took wine (26) and the number of people who took soda (22). This gives us 26 + 22 = <<26+22=48>>48 people.\nHowever, this count includes the 17 people who took both drinks twice. Therefore, to get the total number of unique people who took wine or soda, we need to subtract the overlap (17) from the sum (48): 48 - 17 = <<48-17=31>>31 people.\nHence, there were 31 people altogether at the gathering.

This is because when we add the two groups together, we are counting the people who took both drinks twice.\n\nSo the total number of people at the gathering is 26 + 22 - 17 = 31 + 5 = <<26+22-17=31>>31.\n\nTherefore, there were 31 people in total at the gathering.

One-half of the guests drank soda, one-third of the guests drank sparkling water, and four-fifths of the juices were consumed.  How many recyclable cans and bottles were collected?\n\nOne-half (90 people / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45) were given soda.\nOne-third (90 people / 3 = <<90/3=30>>30) were given sparkling water.\nFour-fifths (50 bottles x 4/5 = <<50*4/5=40>>40) of the juice bottles were consumed.\nThe total number of recyclable drinks containers was 45 + 30 + 40 = <<45+30+40=115>>115.
