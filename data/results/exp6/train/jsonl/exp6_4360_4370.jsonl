The bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter, while the price of the butter was 80% of the price of cheese. Tea was the most expensive and cost twice the price of a package of cheese. If the tea cost $10, how much did Ursula pay for her purchases?\n\nThe tea cost twice as much as a package of cheese, so the price of a package of cheese was 10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.\nIf the price of the butter was 80% of the price of cheese, then Ursula paid 5 * 0.8 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4 for butter.\nThe bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter, so it cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\nSo for all her shopping Ursula paid 5 + 4 + 2 + 10 = $<<5+4+2+10=21>>21.

The bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter, while the price of the butter was 80% of the price of cheese. Tea was the most expensive and cost twice the price of a package of cheese. If the tea cost $10, how much did Ursula pay for her purchases?\n\nThe price of tea was twice the price of cheese, which means one package of cheese costs 10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.\n80% of the price of cheese is 5 * 80/100 = $<<5*80/100=4>>4.\nSo the price of the butter was $4 and the bread was 2 times less expensive, so it costs 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\nSo in total Ursula paid 10 + 5 + 4 + 2 = $<<10+5+4+2=21>>21 for her purchases.

If she has $51 left, how much money, in dollars, did she have at first?\n\nLet X be the money Isabel had at first.\nIsabel spent X / 2 on a toy.\nShe had X / 2 remaining.\nShe spent (X / 2) / 2 = X / 4 on a book.\nShe had (X / 2) - (X / 4) = X / 4 remaining.\nThus, we know X / 4 = $51.\nThus, the initial amount of money Isabel had was X = $51 * 4 = $<<51*4=204>>204. Answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\n\nQuestion: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\n\nIf Amy got $50, and the ratio of the sharing is 2:1:3, then Sandra received $50*(2/1) = $<<50*(2/1)=100>>100. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: George bought some food for his trip: a bottle of juice, a sandwich, and a bottle of milk. The sandwich was for $4, and the juice was two times more expensive. The bottle of milk cost was 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice. How much did George pay for his food?\n\nThe juice was two times more expensive than the $4 sandwich, which means it was 2 * 4 = $<<2*4=8>>8.\nSo the total cost of the sandwich and juice was 8 + 4 = $<<8+4=12>>12.\nThe cost of the bottle of milk was 75/100 * 12 = $<<75/100*12=9>>9.\nSo George paid 12 + 9 = $<<12+9=21>>21 for his food.

The bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter, while the price of the butter was 80% of the price of cheese. Tea was the most expensive and cost twice the price of a package of cheese. If the tea cost $10, how much did Ursula pay for her purchases?\n", "text": "The price of tea was twice the price of cheese, so one package of cheese costs 10 / 2 = $5.\nThe price of butter was 80% of the price of cheese, so Ursula paid 5 * 0.8 = $4 for butter.\nThe bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter, so it cost 4 / 2 = $2.\nTherefore, Ursula paid 5 + 4 + 2 + 10 = $21 for her purchases.

How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?\n\nLet's assume that there are x tripodasauruses in the flock.\nSince each tripodasaurus has 3 legs, the number of legs in the flock would be 3 * x = 3x.\nSince each tripodasaurus also has 1 head, the number of heads in the flock would be x.\nThe total number of heads and legs in the flock is 20 heads and legs, so x + 3x = 20.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5.\nTherefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock.

How much tape will Joy have left over after wrapping tape around the field once?\n\nThe perimeter of the field is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (60ft + 20ft) = 2 * 80ft = <<2*(60ft+20ft)=160>>160ft.\nAfter wrapping tape around the field once, Joy will have 250ft - 160ft = <<250ft-160ft=90>>90ft of tape left over.

How much tape will Joy have left over after wrapping tape around the field once?\n\nTo find the amount of tape needed to wrap around the field once, we need to find the perimeter of the field. The perimeter is equal to 2 times the width plus 2 times the length, or 2 * 20 + 2 * 60 = <<2*20+2*60=160>>160 feet.\nTo find the amount of tape left over, we subtract this amount from the total amount of tape Joy has: 250 - 160 = <<250-160=90>>90 feet.

If he takes route A, it will take him 5 hours to arrive; but if he takes route B, it will only take him 2 hours to arrive at his destination. How much time will he save if he takes route B to Boston and back to his home?\n\nIf he takes route B to Boston, it will take him 2 hours to arrive. Since he will be returning home, he will spend 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours on the round trip.\nIf he takes route A, it will take him 5 hours to arrive. Since he will be returning home, he will spend 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours on the round trip.\nIf he takes route B, he will save 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 hours.
