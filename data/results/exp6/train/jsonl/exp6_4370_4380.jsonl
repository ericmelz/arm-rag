When they checked the pickup truck that was carrying the apples, they found out they still needed to pick 600 apples each to reach the target number. How many apples were they targeting to pick?\n\nFrom the first round, Kaiden and Adriel each picked 400 apples + 3/4*(400 apples) = <<400+3/4*(400)=700>>700 apples.\nFrom the second round, they each picked 600 apples + 700 apples = <<600+700=1300>>1300 apples.\nThey targeted to pick 1300 apples each, therefore, their target was 1300 apples each * 2 = <<1300*2=2600>>2600 apples.

Toby has 5 baseballs and each one makes 80 rotations. His friend has 4 apples and each one makes 101 rotations. How many total rotations of objects are made by the winner?\n\nToby has 5 balls * 80 rotations per ball = <<5*80=400>>400 rotations.\nToby's friend has 4 apples * 101 rotations per apple = <<4*101=404>>404 rotations.\nThe winner has 404 >=  400 meaning the maximum is 404 rotations.
