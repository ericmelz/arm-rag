How many turns does it make in two hours?\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60/30 = <<60/30=2>>2 sets of 30 seconds in a minute.\nHence, a wheel makes 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 turns in a minute.\nIn an hour, there are 60 minutes.\nSo, a wheel makes 12 x 60 = <<12*60=720>>720 turns in an hour.\nTherefore, the wheel makes 720 x 2 = <<720*2=1440>>1440 turns in two hours. Answer: \\boxed{1440}.\n\n\nQuestion: A wheel on a certain machine makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. How many turns does it make in two hours?\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so in one hour there are 60 minutes * 60 seconds = <<60*60=3600>>3600 seconds.\nSo in two hours there are 2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = <<2*3600=7200>>7200 seconds.\nIn each 30 seconds the wheel makes 6 turns, so in one second it makes 6 turns / 30 seconds = <<6/30=0.2>>0.2 turns/second.\nSo in 7200 seconds the wheel makes 7200 seconds * 0.2 turns/second = <<7200*0.2=1440>>1440 turns. Answer: \\boxed{1440}.\n\n\nQuestion: A wheel on a certain machine makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. How many turns does it make in two hours?\n\nTo find the number of turns the wheel makes in two hours, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, and since each minute has 60 seconds, there are 60 x 60 = <<60*60=3600>>3600 seconds in an hour.\nTherefore, there are 3600 x 2 = <<3600*2=7200>>7200 seconds in two hours.\n\nSince the wheel makes 6 turns every 30 seconds, it will make 7200 / 30 = <<7200/30=240>>240 sets of 6 turns in two hours.\nTherefore, the wheel will make a total of 240 x 6 = <<240*6=1440>>1440 turns in two hours. Answer: \\boxed{1440}.\n\n\nQuestion: A wheel on a certain machine makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. How many turns does it make in two hours?\n\nTo find the number of turns the wheel makes in two hours, we first need to find the number of turns it makes in 1 second.\n\nSince the wheel makes 6 turns every 30 seconds, we divide the number of turns by the number of seconds: 6 turns / 30 seconds = 0.2 turns/second.\n\nIn 2 hours, there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes in 2 hours.\nSince there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, there are 120 * 60 = <<120*60=7200>>7200 seconds in 2 hours.\nTherefore, the number of turns the wheel makes in two hours is 0.2 turns/second * 7200 seconds = 1440 turns.

In total, how many chairs have been produced after 6 hours?\n\nIn total each of them produces 4 chairs/hour * 3 workers = <<4*3=12>>12 chairs/hour.\nThey produce one chair more after 6 hours, so in 6 hours there are an additional 6 hours / 6 hours = <<6/6=1>>1 additional chair produced by the group.\nSo in total during 6 hours the group of workers produces 12 chairs/hour * 6 hours + 1 additional chair = <<12*6+1=73>>73 chairs. Answer: \\boxed{73}.\n\n\nQuestion: A wheel on a certain machine makes 6 turns every 30 seconds. How many turns does it make in two hours?\n", "text": "To find the number of turns the wheel makes in two hours, we need to first find the number of turns it makes in one second.\n\nSince the wheel makes 6 turns every 30 seconds, we can simplify this to 1 turn every 5 seconds (30 seconds / 6 turns = 5 seconds/turn).\n\nTo find the number of turns per second, we divide 1 turn by 5 seconds, which gives us 1/5 = 0.2 turns/second.\n\nIn two hours, there are 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 7200 seconds.\n\nTo find the number of turns in two hours, we multiply the number of seconds by the turns per second: 7200 seconds * 0.2 turns/second = 1440 turns.\n\nTherefore, the wheel makes 1440 turns in two hours. Answer: \\boxed{1440}."}
