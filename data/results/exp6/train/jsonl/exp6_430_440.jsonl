When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining.  How many plums did she buy?\n\nSince half of the fruit fell out of the bag, the total number of pieces of fruit Tanya initially had was 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 pieces.\nWe know that Tanya bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, and 2 pineapples, so she bought 6+4+2= 12 of those fruits.\nThus, the number of plums she bought is 18-12=<<18-12=6>>6 plums.

When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining.  How many plums did she buy?\n\nIf Tanya had half the fruit remaining when she got home, and she counted 9 fruits left in the bag, then she initially had twice that amount.  Therefore, she had 2*9=<<2*9=18>>18 fruits to begin with.\nSince the total count of fruits she bought was 6 pears, 4 apples, 2 pineapples plus the plums must have equaled 18 fruits, then she must have bought 18-6-4-2=<<18-6-4-2=6>>6 plums.

When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining.  How many plums did she buy?\n\nHalf of the fruit that was in the bag is 9 pieces so if half is 9 then double the amount of pieces in the bag must be 9*2 = <<9*2=18>>18 pieces\nWe know she bought 6 pears and 4 granny smith apples for a total of 6+4 = <<6+4=10>>10 pieces\nThis means 18-10 = <<18-10=8>>8 pieces must be the number of pineapples and plums\nWe know she bought 2 pineapples so that leaves 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 pieces left to be the number of plums.

So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed.

Her three younger siblings need pencils for class and their dad asks her to share all her pencils, giving each an equal number of pencils, regardless of color. He tells her she can keep 10 of them for herself. How many pencils does each sibling get?\n\nTeresa has a total of 14 colored pencils + 35 black pencils = <<14+35=49>>49 pencils.\nAfter Teresa keeps 10 pencils for herself, she has 49 pencils - 10 pencils = <<49-10=39>>39 pencils to share.\nEach of her three siblings will receive 39 pencils / 3 siblings = <<39/3=13>>13 pencils per sibling. Answer: \\boxed{13}.\n\n\nQuestion: Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens. If she had 60 pens and gave eight pens and 6 pencils to each of her seven friends and kept the rest for herself, how many pens and pencils did she have left?\n", "text": "Catherine initially had the same number of pencils and pens, which is 60 pens. She gave 8 pens to each of her 7 friends, so she gave away a total of 8 pens/friend * 7 friends = 56 pens. She also gave away 6 pencils/friend * 7 friends = 42 pencils. Therefore, she gave away a total of 56 pens + 42 pencils = 98 items. Since she initially had 60 pens and 60 pencils, she has a total of 60 + 60 = 120 items. Subtracting the items she gave away, she has 120 items - 98 items = 22 items left. So, Catherine has 22 pens and pencils left. Answer: \\boxed{22}."}

He can sell each chicken for $1.50. A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2. Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed from the time it hatches to the time he sells it. If he makes $65 profit from selling chickens, how many did he sell?\n\nThe cost of feed per chicken is $2 / (20 lbs/bag) = $<<2/20=0.10>>0.10 per pound.\nTherefore, the cost of feed per chicken is $0.10/lb * 2 lbs/chicken = $<<0.10*2=0.20>>0.20.\nHe makes a profit of $1.50 - $0.20 = $<<1.5-0.20=1.30>>1.30 per chicken.\nHe sold $65 / $1.30 per chicken = <<65/1.30=50>>50 chickens.
