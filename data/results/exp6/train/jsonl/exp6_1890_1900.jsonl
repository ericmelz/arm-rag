She wants each of them to spend the same number of minutes working. Sweeping takes 3 minutes per room, washing the dishes takes 2 minutes per dish, and doing laundry takes 9 minutes per load. If Anna does the sweeping for 10 rooms and Billy does two loads of laundry, how many dishes should Billy wash so they spend the same amount of time doing chores?\n\nFirst find how long Anna spends sweeping by multiplying the time per room by the number of rooms: 3 minutes/room * 10 rooms = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes\nThen find how long Billy spends doing laundry by multiplying the time per load by the number of loads: 9 minutes/load * 2 loads = <<9*2=18>>18 minutes\nThen subtract Billy and Anna's total chore time from each other to find the difference: 30 minutes - 18 minutes = <<30-18=12>>12 minutes\nThen divide the time difference by the time per dish to find the number of dishes Billy should wash: 12 minutes / 2 minutes/dish = <<12/2=6>>6 dishes.

In one show, Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes.  Then, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.  And then, finally, Petra stands of his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that the three entertainers stand on their back legs?\n\nPolly stands on her back legs for 3 times the length of Pulsar, for a total of 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes.\nPetra stands on his back legs for 1/6 the length of Polly, for a total of (1/6)*30=5 minutes.\nIn total, the three entertainers stand on their back legs for 10+30+5=<<10+30+5=45>>45 minutes.

After 7 minutes, how much higher will Jason be than Matt?\n\nFirst find how many feet higher Jason climbs than Matt each minute: 12 feet/minute - 6 feet/minute = <<12-6=6>>6 feet/minute\nThen multiply that number by the number of minutes to find the total difference in their heights: 6 feet/minute * 7 minutes = <<6*7=42>>42 feet.

If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour?\n", "text": "First find the number of towels Jane can fold in one minute by dividing the total number of towels by the number of minutes: 3 towels / 5 minutes = 0.6 towels/minute\nThen find the number of towels Kyla can fold in one minute by dividing the total number of towels by the number of minutes: 5 towels / 10 minutes = 0.5 towels/minute\nThen find the number of towels Anthony can fold in one minute by dividing the total number of towels by the number of minutes: 7 towels / 20 minutes = 0.35 towels/minute\nThen add the number of towels each person can fold per minute to find the total number of towels folded per minute: 0.6 towels/minute + 0.5 towels/minute + 0.35 towels/minute = 1.45 towels/minute\nThen multiply the number of towels folded per minute by the number of minutes per hour to find the total number of towels folded in an hour: 1.45 towels/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 87 towels.
