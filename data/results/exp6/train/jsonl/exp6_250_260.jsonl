We know that 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, so for every 1 inch, it represents 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.\nSince 3 3/8 inches represents 3 + 3/8 = 3.375 inches.\nThe actual distance between the towns is 3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = <<3.375*32=108>>108 miles. Answer: \\boxed{108}.\n\n\nQuestion: A piece of wire 5 feet 4 inches long was divided into 4 equal parts. How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?\n\n5 feet 4 inches is equal to 5 x 12 + 4 = <<5*12+4=64>>64 inches.\nEach part is 64 / 4 = <<64/4=16>>16 inches long. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: A piece of wire 5 feet 4 inches long was divided into 4 equal parts. How long was each part in inches if 1 foot is equal to 12 inches?\n\nThe total length of the wire in inches is 5 x 12 + 4 = <<5*12+4=64>>64 inches.\nEach part is 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 inches long. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?\n", "text": "Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, then 1 inch represents 8/1/4 = <<8/(1/4)=32>>32 miles.\nTherefore, 3 3/8 inches represents 3 3/8 x 32 = <<3+3/8*32=108>>108 miles.
