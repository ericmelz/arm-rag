What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?\n\nThe second cat meowed twice as frequently as the first cat, or 3 x 2= <<3*2=6>>6 times per minute.\nThe third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat, or 6/3=<<6/3=2>>2 times per minute.\nCombined, the three meowed 3 + 6 + 2 = <<3+6+2=11>>11 times per minute.\nIn 5 minutes, they meowed a combined 11 x 5 = <<11*5=55>>55 times.

And the third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat.  What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?\n\nIf the first cat is meowing 3 times per minute, then after 5 minutes it has meowed 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 times.\nIf the second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat, then it meows 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times per minute.\nAfter 5 minutes of meowing at this rate, the second cat has meowed 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 times.\nIf the third cat meows at one-third the rate of the second cat, then it meows 6/3=<<6/3=2>>2 times per minute.\nAfter 5 minutes of meowing at this rate, the third cat has meowed 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 times.\nThe combined total number of meows from the three cats over 5 minutes is 15+30+10=<<15+30+10=55>>55 meows.

And the third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat.  What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?\n\nIf the first cat meowed 3 times per minute, then in 5 minutes, the first cat would meow 5*3 = <<3*5=15>>15 times.\nIf the second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat, then in 5 minutes, the second cat would meow 5*3*2 = <<5*3*2=30>>30 times.\nIf the third cat meows at one-third the rate of the second cat, then in 5 minutes, the third cat would meow 5*3*2*(1/3) = <<5*3*2*(1/3)=10>>10 times.\nCombined, the three cats would meow a total of 15+30+10 = <<15+30+10=55>>55 times in 5 minutes.

And the third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat.  What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?\n\nThe second cat meowed twice as frequently as the first cat's 3 meows per minute so it meowed 2*3 = <<3*2=6>>6 meows per minute\nThe third cat meowed 1/3rd as frequently as the second cat's 6 meows per minute so it meowed .333*6 = 2 meows per minute\nAll total, in a minute, they meowed 3+6+2 = <<3+6+2=11>>11 times\nOver the course of 5 minutes they meowed 11*5 = <<11*5=55>>55 times.

Each scoop costs $1.5 and they get the same amount as each other. If they leave with $1 in change each, how many scoops did they each buy?\n\nThe dinner cost 40*(3/4)=$<<40*(3/4)=30>>30\nThey spent $3 on dinner because 40-30=$<<40-30=10>>10\nThey each got $9 of ice cream because 10/2=$<<10/2=5>>5\nThey each bought 6 scoops because 9/1.5=<<9/1.5=6>>6.
