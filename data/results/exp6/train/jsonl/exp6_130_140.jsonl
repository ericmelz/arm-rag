How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?\n", "text": "The discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $<<3-2=1>>1.\nSo, you will save $1 x 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3 if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk.\nThe total discount for the 5 boxes of cereal is $1 x 5 = $<<1*5=5>>5.\nTherefore, you will save $5 + $3 = $<<5+3=8>>8 if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal. Answer: \\boxed{8}."}
