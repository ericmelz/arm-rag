Answer: \\boxed{195}.\n\n\nQuestion: Celina enjoys hiking in the mountains. Due to a lack of proper equipment, she decided to order a new pair of boots, a flashlight, and a special hoodie. The hoodie cost $80 and the flashlight was only 20% of that price. The pair of boots cost was $110, but due to a special promotion, Celina was able to buy them 10% cheaper. How much did Celina spend in total on the above-mentioned equipment?\n\nThe flashlight cost was only 20% of the hoodie's price, so it was 0.2 * 80 = $<<0.2*80=16>>16.\nThat means the cost of the boots was 110 - 10 / 100 * 110 = $<<110-(10/100)*110=99>>99.\nThe total cost of the boots, the hoodie, and the flashlight is 99 + 80 + 16 = $<<99+80+16=195>>195.
