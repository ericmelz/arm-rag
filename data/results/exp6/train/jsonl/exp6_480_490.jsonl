How much profit did Jonah make?\n\nJonah spent 6 x $3 = $<<6*3=18>>18 on pineapples.\nHe was able to cut the pineapples into 6 x 12 = <<6*12=72>>72 pineapple rings.\nHe sold 72/4 = <<72/4=18>>18 sets of pineapple rings.\nSo, he earned 18 x $5 = $<<18*5=90>>90 from selling the pineapple rings.\nTherefore, Jonah made a profit of $90 - $18 = $<<90-18=72>>72. Answer: \\boxed{72}.\n\n\nQuestion: Running for 2 hours, Jonah burnt 30 calories every hour. How many more calories would he have lost if he would have run for five hours?\n\nIf Jonah burnt 30 calories every hour for 2 hours, he burned 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 calories.\nTherefore, if Jonah ran for five hours, he would have burned 30 * 5 = <<30*5=150>>150 calories.\nHence, Jonah would have lost an additional 150 - 60 = <<150-60=90>>90 calories if he would have run for five hours. Answer: \\boxed{90}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jonah bought 6 pineapples for $3 each. Each pineapple could be cut into 12 pineapple rings. He sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each. How much profit did Jonah make?\n", "text": "Jonah spent a total of 6 * $3 = $<<6*3=18>>18 for the 6 pineapples.\nHe was able to make 6 * 12 = <<6*12=72>>72 pineapple rings from the 6 pineapples.\nIf he sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each, then he sold a total of 72 / 4 = <<72/4=18>>18 sets of pineapple rings.\nTherefore, Jonah made $18 * $5 = $<<18*5=90>>90 from selling the pineapple rings.\nHis profit is $90 - $18 = $<<90-18=72>>72.
