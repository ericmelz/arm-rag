If he has 12 blue picks, what is the total number of yellow picks in his collection?\n\nHalf of his picks are red, so 1 - 0.50 = 0.50 of his picks are not red.\n1/3 of his picks are blue, so (1/3) * (total number of picks) = 12\nTherefore, (total number of picks) = 3 * 12 = 36.\nThe (total number of picks - the number of red and blue picks) = 36 - 12 - (36 * 0.50) = 36 * 0.50 - 12 = <<36*0.50-12=6>>6 yellow picks.

Half of his picks are red, one-third of the picks are blue, and the rest are yellow.  If he has 12 blue picks, what is the total number of yellow picks in his collection?\n", "text": "Since half of Johnny's picks are red and one-third are blue, the remaining portion must be yellow. Therefore, the total number of yellow picks is equal to the total number of picks minus the number of red picks minus the number of blue picks. Given that Johnny has 12 blue picks, we need to find the total number of picks.\n\nTo find the total number of picks, we can use the fact that one-third of the picks are blue. Let x be the total number of picks. We can set up the equation:\n\n1/3 * x = 12\n\nSolving for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nx = 12 * 3\nx = 36\n\nNow that we know x is 36, we can find the number of red picks. Since half of Johnny's picks are red, we can calculate:\n\n1/2 * 36 = 18\n\nTherefore, Johnny has 18 red picks. \n\nFinally, we can find the number of yellow picks:\n\nyellow picks = total picks - red picks - blue picks\nyellow picks = 36 - 18 - 12\nyellow picks = 6\n\nSo, the total number of yellow picks in Johnny's collection is 6.
