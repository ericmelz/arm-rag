How old is Hannah if she is twice as old as the sum of her brother's ages?\n\nThe sum of her brother's ages is 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 years old.\nHannah is 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old. Answer: \\boxed{48}.\n\n\nQuestion: Hannah's family has ten pigs on their farm. They also have three fewer than twice as many cows as pigs and six more goats than cows. How many animals do they have on their farm?\n", "text": "Twice the number of pigs is 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cows.\nThree fewer than twice the number of pigs is 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17 cows.\nThe number of goats is 17 + 6 = <<17+6=23>>23 goats.\nHannah's family has a total of 10 + 17 + 23 = <<10+17+23=50>>50 animals on their farm.

She looks at more TVs on an auction site online. If Beatrice looked at 42 TVs in all, how many did look at on the auction site?\n\nBeatrice looks at 3 * 8 TVs = <<3*8=24>>24 TVs at the second store.\nThus, she looked at 24 + 8 = <<24+8=32>>32 TVs at the two first stores.\nThat means Beatrice looked at 42 - 32 = <<42-32=10>>10 TVs on the auction site.

She looks at more TVs on an auction site online. If Beatrice looked at 42 TVs in all, how many did look at on the auction site?\n\nFirst find the number of TVs Beatrice looked at at the online store: 8 TVs * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 TVs\nThen subtract that number from the total number of TVs Beatrice looked at to find the number she looked at on the auction site: 42 TVs - 24 TVs - 8 TVs = <<42-24-8=10>>10 TVs.
