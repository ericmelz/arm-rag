How many miles does the driver travel in a week?\n\nThe driver travels 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = <<30*3=90>>90 miles per day for Monday to Saturday.\nHe also travels 25 miles/hour * 4 hours = <<25*4=100>>100 miles per day for Monday to Saturday.\nSo, the driver travels 90 miles + 100 miles = <<90+100=190>>190 miles per day from Monday to Saturday.\nTherefore, the driver travels 190 miles/day * 6 days = <<190*6=1140>>1140 miles in a week.

He makes the round trip to school two times (when taking the children to school and when bringing them back) every day for 4 days a week. Then he makes a round trip to the market once during weekends. What is his car's mileage for a typical week?\n\nThe total mileage for the trip to the school and back is 2.5 miles * 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 miles.\nIn a week, he makes this trip 4 days/week * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 times.\nSo the total mileage for the trips to the school is 5 miles/trip * 8 trips/week = <<5*8=40>>40 miles/week.\nThe total mileage for the trip to the market is 2 miles * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 miles.\nIn a week, he makes this trip once, so the total mileage for the trips to the market is 4 miles/trip * 1 trip/week = <<4*1=4>>4 miles/week.\nTherefore, his car's mileage for a typical week is 40 miles/week + 4 miles/week = <<40+4=44>>44 miles/week. Answer: \\boxed{44}.\n\n\nQuestion: Stephen rides his bicycle to church.  During the first third of his trip, he travels at a speed of 16 miles per hour. During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mr. Maxwell takes 1 hr to drive to work in the morning but 1 and half hours to drive back home in the evening. If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\n\nWe can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nIn the morning, Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance he travels is 30 miles.\n\nIn the evening, he takes 1.5 hours to drive back home. Since the morning and evening traffic is similar, we can assume that the distance is the same, 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance for the return journey is also 30 miles.\n\nThe total time for the return journey is 1.5 hours.\n\nThus, the average speed of the return journey is 30 miles / 1.5 hours = <<30/1.5=20>>20 mph.

Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?\n\nTo find out how many pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into, we need to consider the eating habits of each person. \n\nManny wants one piece.\nAaron doesn't want any lasagna, so we don't need to account for him.\n\nKai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will want 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pieces.\n\nRaphael will eat half as much as Manny, so Raphael will want 1 * 0.5 = <<1*0.5=0.5>>0.5 pieces.\n\nLisa will eat 2 pieces, plus whatever Raphael has left, so Lisa will want 2 + 0.5 = <<2+0.5=2.5>>2.5 pieces.\n\nIn total, Manny should cut the lasagna into 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 = <<1+2+0.5+2.5=6>>6 pieces.

Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?\n\nLet's break down how much each person will eat:\n- Aaron will not eat lasagna.\n- Manny will eat 1 piece.\n- Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 pieces.\n- Raphael will eat half as much as Manny, so he will eat 1 * 0.5 = <<1*0.5=0.5>>0.5 pieces.\n- Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any leftovers from Raphael, which is 0.5 pieces.\n- So Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 = <<2+0.5=2.5>>2.5 pieces.\n\nAdding up the individual amounts, in total, Manny should cut his lasagna into 0 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 = <<0+1+2+0.5+2.5=6>>6 pieces.

How much profit, in dollars, was made on Wednesday?\n", "text": "Let x be the profit made on Wednesday.\nThe fraction of profit made on Monday is 1/3 and the profit made on Tuesday is 1/4.\nSo, the fraction of profit made on Wednesday is 1 - 1/3 - 1/4 = 12/12 - 4/12 - 3/12 = 5/12.\nSince the shop made $1200 profit in total, the profit made on Wednesday is $1200 x 5/12 = $<<1200*5/12=500>>500. Answer: \\boxed{500}."}

Tony is washing a pair of pants, 2 shirts, a pair of shorts, and 3 pairs of socks. How many more pairs of underwear can he add to the wash and not break the rule?\n\nThe weight of the pair of pants is 10 ounces/pants * 1 pant = <<10*1=10>>10 ounces\nThe weight of both shirts is 2 shirts * 5 ounces/shirt = <<2*5=10>>10 ounces\nThe weight of the pair of shorts is 8 ounces/shorts * 1 shorts = <<8*1=8>>8 ounces\nThe weight of the 3 pairs of socks is 3 pairs * 2 ounces/pair = <<3*2=6>>6 ounces\nThe current weight of all the clothes is 10 ounces + 10 ounces + 8 ounces + 6 ounces = <<10+10+8+6=34>>34 ounces\nTony can add 50 ounces - 34 ounces = <<50-34=16>>16 ounces of clothes\nThus, Tony can add 16 ounces / 4 ounces/underwear = <<16/4=4>>4 more pairs of underwear to the wash.
