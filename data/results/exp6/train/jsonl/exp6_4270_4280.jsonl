When he arrives there, he will have been gone from the Park Office 32 minutes altogether. If he had walked to the Lake Park restaurant from the Park office before taking the 15 minute walk to Hidden Lake, how long is the walk from Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant?\n\nLet's assume that the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant takes x minutes.\nAfter walking to the Lake Park restaurant, Dante walks to Hidden Lake, which takes 15 minutes.\nFrom Hidden Lake, Dante walks back to the Park Office, which takes 7 minutes.\nTherefore, the total time Dante is away from the Park Office is 15 + 7 = 22 minutes.\nSince he has been away from the Park Office for a total of 32 minutes, this means he spent 32 - 22 = 10 minutes at the Lake Park restaurant.\nTherefore, the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant takes x = 10 minutes.

If he had walked to the Lake Park restaurant from the Park office before taking the 15 minute walk to Hidden Lake, how long is the walk from Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant?\n\nIf Dante spends a total of 32 minutes away from the Park Office, and it takes him 15 minutes to go to Hidden Lake and 7 minutes to walk back to the Park Office, then he spends 32 - 15 - 7 = <<32-15-7=10>>10 minutes at the Park Office.\nTherefore, Dante walks 10 minutes from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant.

It takes 1 hour for Rob to get to the national park and it takes three times as much time for Mark to get to the national park. If Rob leaves his home at 11 a.m., at what time should Mark leave his home so that they both arrive at the same time?\n\nSince it takes 1 hour for Rob to get to the national park, if he leaves his home at 11 a.m., he will arrive at the national park at 11 + 1 = <<11+1=12>>12 p.m.\nIf it takes three times as much time for Mark to get to the national park, Mark will take 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours to get to the national park.\nFor Mark to arrive at the national park at 12 p.m, he should leave his home at 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 a.m. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Austin and Jake start descending from the 9th floor of a building at the same time. Austin uses the elevator and Jake uses the stairs, descending 3 steps every second. The stairs have 30 steps across each floor. If the elevator will take a minute to get to ground level, how many seconds later will Jake get to the ground floor?\n\nThere are 30 x 9 = <<30*9=270>>270 steps from the 9th floor to the ground floor.\nThis means Jake will take 270/3 = <<270/3=90>>90 seconds to get to the ground floor.\nSince a minute is equal to 60 seconds, Jake will get to the ground floor 90 - 60 = <<90-60=30>>30 seconds later.

If Mary's mother paid a total of $16 for the grocery, how much should Mary and her two friends pay each for the chicken?\n\nThe cost of the beef was 3 pounds x $4/pound = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nSo the total cost of the chicken was $16 - $12 - $1 = $<<16-12-1=3>>3.\nHence, Mary and her two friends should each pay $3/3 = $<<3/3=1>>1 each for the chicken.

If the new city should have half the number of stores, twice as many hospitals, 50 fewer schools, and 5 more police stations, what is the total number of buildings required for this project?\n\nThe number of stores in the new city will be 1/2 * 2000 stores = <<2000*1/2=1000>>1000 stores.\nThe new city will have twice as many hospitals as Pittsburg city, a total of 2 * 500 hospitals = <<2*500=1000>>1000 hospitals.\nThe new city will have 50 fewer schools than Pittsburg city, a total of 200 schools - 50 schools = <<200-50=150>>150 schools.\nThe new city will have 5 more police stations than Pittsburg city, a total of 20 police stations + 5 police stations = <<20+5=25>>25 police stations.\nThe total number of buildings required for the new city project is 1000 stores + 1000 hospitals + 150 schools + 25 police stations = <<1000+1000+150+25=2175>>2175 buildings.
