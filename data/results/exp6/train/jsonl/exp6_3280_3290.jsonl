All the walls in Matt's house are 10 feet tall. How many total square feet of wall does Matt need to paint?\n\nFirst find the area of one wall in the living room: 40 feet * 10 feet = <<40*10=400>>400 square feet\nThen multiply that number by 3 to find the total area of the living room walls: 400 square feet/wall * 3 walls = <<400*3=1200>>1200 square feet\nThen find the area of one wall in the bedroom: 10 feet * 10 feet = <<10*10=100>>100 square feet\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the area of the small walls: 100 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<100*2=200>>200 square feet\nThen multiply the length of the longer walls by the height to find the area of the longer walls: 12 feet * 10 feet = <<12*10=120>>120 square feet/long wall\nThen multiply that number by 2 to find the area of both long walls: 120 square feet/wall * 2 walls = <<120*2=240>>240 square feet\nThen add the area of both types of walls to find the total area Matt needs to paint: 1200 square feet + 200 square feet + 240 square feet = <<1200+200+240=1640>>1640 square feet.

Since the guest bedroom is a quarter of the size of the master bedroom suite, the size of the guest bedroom is x/4 sq ft. \nThe living room, dining room, and kitchen combined take up 1,000 sq ft, so the remaining space after accounting for these rooms is 2,300 sq ft - 1,000 sq ft = 1,300 sq ft. \nThe guest bedroom and master bedroom suite combined take up a total of x sq ft + x/4 sq ft = 5x/4 sq ft. \nTherefore, we have the equation 5x/4 = 1,300 sq ft. \nTo solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4/5: x = 1,300 sq ft * 4/5 = 1,040 sq ft. \nTherefore, the master bedroom suite is 1,040 sq ft.

If the construction workers each make $100/day, the electrician makes double what a worker is paid and the plumber makes 250% of a worker's salary, how much are the overall labor costs for one day?\n\nThe electrician makes double what a worker is paid, so he makes 2 * $100/day = $<<2*100=200>>200/day\nThe plumber makes 250% of a worker's salary, so he makes 2.5 * $100/day = $<<2.5*100=250>>250/day\nSo overall the labor costs are $200/day + $250/day + $100/day + $100/day = $<<200+250+100+100=650>>650/day.

He'll have to get a loan for the rest of the amount and make 48 equal monthly payments on it. Each month, he also has to pay interest equal to 5% of that month's payment. How much will Jason's monthly payments be?\n\nFirst find the total price Jason has to get a loan for: $32,000 - $8,000 = $<<32000-8000=24000>>24,000\nThen divide the cost of the loan by the number of payments to find the amount of each monthly payment before interest: $24,000 / 48 months = $<<24000/48=500>>500/month\nThen multiply the cost of each payment by 5% to find how much additional money Jason has to pay in interest each month: $500/month * 5% = $<<500*5*.01=25>>25/month\nThen add the cost of each payment to the interest to find the total cost of each payment: $500/month + $25/month = $<<500+25=525>>525/month.
