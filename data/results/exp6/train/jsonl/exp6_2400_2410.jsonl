Answer: \\boxed{140}.\n\n\nQuestion: Kira wants some new music on her phone. She downloads 10 songs in the morning. Later on that day, she finds 15 more songs she likes so she downloads them, and at night a friend of hers recommends 3 more songs she also downloads. Knowing that each song has a size of 5 MB, how much memory space in MB will the new songs occupy?\n\nIn the morning, Kira downloads 10 songs * 5 MB/song = <<10*5=50>>50 MB of memory.\nWhen she finds 15 more songs later in the day, she downloads 15 songs * 5 MB/song = <<15*5=75>>75 MB of memory.\nAt night, Kira downloads 3 more songs * 5 MB/song = <<3*5=15>>15 MB of memory.\nIn total, the new songs will occupy 50 MB + 75 MB + 15 MB = <<50+75+15=140>>140 MB of memory. Answer: \\boxed{140}.\n\n\nQuestion: Vivian plays 10 Spotify songs every day. Her best friend Clara plays 2 fewer songs each day. If in June they didn't play any song during the weekends only, and there were 8 weekend days in June, what's the total number of songs they both listened to in that month?\n", "text": "In June, there are 30 days. However, they didn't play any songs during the 8 weekend days. So, the total number of weekdays in June is 30 - 8 = 22.\nVivian plays 10 songs every weekday, so she played a total of 10 * 22 = 220 songs in June.\nClara plays 2 fewer songs each day, so she played 10 - 2 = 8 songs every weekday.\nTherefore, Clara played a total of 8 * 22 = 176 songs in June.\nThe total number of songs they both listened to in that month is 220 + 176 = 396. Answer: \\boxed{396}."}
