Roger, the oldest one, said that he has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined and that his retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience. Peter said that when he came to the company his daughter was 7 years old, and now she is 19 years old. Tom then said he has twice as many years of experience as Robert. Robert said that he has 4 years of experience less than Peter but 2 more years of experience than Mike. How many more years does Roger have to work before he retires?\n\nLet's analyze the information given:\n\n1) Roger has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined.\nLet's say that the other four coworkers have a combined experience of x years.\nThis means that Roger also has x years of experience.\n\n2) Roger's retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience.\nSince Roger currently has x years of experience, he needs to work for 50 - x years before he retires.\n\n3) Peter said that when he came to the company, his daughter was 7 years old, and now she is 19 years old.\nThis means that Peter has worked for 19 - 7 = 12 years.\n\n4) Tom has twice as many years of experience as Robert.\nLet's say Robert has y years of experience.\nThis means Tom has 2y years of experience.\n\n5) Robert has 4 years of experience less than Peter but 2 more years of experience than Mike.\nLet's say Peter has z years of experience.\nThis means that Robert has z - 4 years of experience.\nMike has z - 4 - 2 = z - 6 years of experience.\n\nTo find the values of x, y, and z, we can start with the information given about Peter, since it is more straightforward.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that Peter has 12 years of experience (z = 12).\n\nNow, let's use the information from point 5:\nRobert has 4 years less than Peter, so y = z - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.\nMike has 2 years less than Robert, so Mike has y - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 years of experience.\n\nNow let's go back to point 4:\nTom has twice as many years of experience as Robert, so Tom has 2y = 2 * 8 = 16 years of experience.\n\nFinally, we can go back to point 1:\nRoger has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined.\nSo, Roger has x = 12 + 8 + 6 + 16 = 42 years of experience.\n\nRoger's retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience.\nTherefore, he needs to work for 50 - 42 = 8 more years before he retires.

Elle and Andrea will split the cost for buying 4 cans of soda which cost $1.50 each, and chicken wings for $10. Joe will buy a cake that costs $5. How much more will Mary spend than the rest of the firm put together?\n\nMary will spend a total of $20 + $2 = $<<20+2=22>>22.\nElle and Andrea will spend a total of $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6 for soda.\nThey will also spend a total of $6 + $10 = $<<6+10=16>>16 for soda and chicken wings.\nJoe will spend a total of $5.\nThe total amount that Elle, Andrea, and Joe will spend is $16 + $5 = $<<16+5=21>>21.\nTherefore, Mary will spend $22 - $21 = $<<22-21=1>>1 more than the rest of the firm put together.

He donates half of the remaining total to the local homeless shelter, and the other half to the local food bank. Andrew also decides to donate $10 from his own piggy bank to the local homeless shelter. How much money in total does Andrew donate to the homeless shelter?\n\nAfter subtracting the $100 for the cost of ingredients, Andrew has $400 - $100 = $<<400-100=300>>300 remaining.\nAndrew donates half of this, which is $300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150.\nIncluding his own donation of $10, Andrew donates a total of $150 + $10 = $<<150+10=160>>160 to the homeless shelter.

If my total bill was $140, the sales tax in my city is 10%, I ordered a NY Striploin for $80, and I ordered a glass of wine for $10, how much did they charge me for gratuities?\n\nTo calculate the amount charged for gratuities, we first need to find the total amount before taxes by adding the cost of the NY Striploin and the glass of wine: $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of taxes by multiplying the total amount before taxes by the tax rate: $90 * 0.10 = $<<90*0.10=9>>9.\nFinally, we can calculate the total bill by adding the total amount before taxes and the amount of taxes: $90 + $9 = $<<90+9=99>>99.\nSince the total bill was $140, the amount charged for gratuities without the customer's awareness is $140 - $99 = $<<140-99=41>>41.
