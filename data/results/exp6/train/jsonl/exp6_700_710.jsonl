If two white socks cost 45 cents, how much would you pay for 15 brown socks?\n\nIf two white socks cost 45 cents, then one white sock cost 45/2 = <<45/2=22.5>>22.5 cents.\nAnd since two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock, then a single brown sock costs 45 - 25 = <<45-25=20>>20 cents.\nSo 15 brown socks would cost 20 x 15 = <<20*15=300>>300 cents.\nTherefore, you would pay 300 cents or $<<300/100=3>>3 for 15 brown socks. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock. If two white socks cost 45 cents, how much would you pay for 15 brown socks?\n\nWe know that two white socks cost 45 cents, so one white sock costs 45 cents / 2 = 22.5 cents.\nSince two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock, a single brown sock costs 45 cents - 25 cents = 20 cents.\nTherefore, 15 brown socks would cost 20 cents per sock * 15 socks = 300 cents.\nYou would pay 300 cents / 100 cents/dollar = $<<300/100=3>>3 for 15 brown socks.

If the red socks cost $3 each, how much did he pay for each blue pair?\n\nLuis spent 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 dollars on red socks.\nThat means he spent 42 - 12 = <<42-12=30>>30 dollars on blue socks.\nHe bought 6 pairs of blue socks, so each pair costs 30 / 6 = <<30/6=5>>5 dollars. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Luis needed to buy some socks. He bought 4 pairs of red socks and 6 pairs of blue ones. In total, he spent $42. If the red socks cost $3 each, how much did he pay for each blue pair?\n\nLuis spent 4 * $3 = $<<4*3=12>>12 on red socks.\nHe therefore spent $42 - $12 = $<<42-12=30>>30 on blue socks.\nThus, he paid $30 / 6 = $<<30/6=5>>5 for each blue pair. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Sally and Bob have made plans to go on a trip at the end of the year. They both decide to work as babysitters and save half of what they've earned for their trip. If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?\n\nSally makes $6 per day and saves half of it, so she saves $6/2 = $<<6/2=3>>3 per day.\nBob makes $4 per day and saves half of it, so he saves $4/2 = $<<4/2=2>>2 per day.\nCombined, they save a total of $3 + $2 = $<<3+2=5>>5 per day.\nIn a year, with 365 days, they will save in total $5 * 365 = $<<5*365=1825>>1825.

If Theresa's 3 sons each eat two-thirds of the meatballs on their respective plates, how many meatballs are still left on their plates altogether?\n\nTheresa's 3 sons each eat 2/3 of the meatballs, so they eat a total of 3 * 2/3 = <<3*2/3=2>>2 meatballs on each of their plates.\nThat means 3 meatballs - 2 meatballs = <<3-2=1>>1 meatball is still on each of their plates.\nSince there are 3 plates, then 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 meatballs are still left on their plates altogether.

If Theresa's 3 sons each eat two-thirds of the meatballs on their respective plates, how many meatballs are still left on their plates altogether?\n\nSince there are 3 sons and each son has a plate with 3 meatballs, then there are 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 meatballs on their plates altogether.\nIf each son ate two-thirds of the meatballs on their respective plates, then there were 3 x (2/3) = <<3*(2/3)=2>>2 meatballs eaten by each son.\nThe total number of meatballs eaten was 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6\nTherefore, 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 meatballs were still left on their plates.

If Theresa's 3 sons each eat two-thirds of the meatballs on their respective plates, how many meatballs are still left on their plates altogether?\n\nThree separate plates each contain 3 meatballs so 3*3 = <<3*3=9>>9 meatballs\nSince each son consumes two-thirds of their plates meatballs, then 2/3 x 9 = <<2/3*9=6>>6 meatballs are being eaten\nIf there are 9 meatballs total and 6 of them are eaten then 9-6 = <<9-6=3>>3 meatballs left.
