How much farther does Emily walk to school and back in five days?\n\nTroy walks 75 x 2 = <<75*2=150>>150 meters every day.\nEmily walks 98 x 2 = <<98*2=196>>196 meters every day.\nTherefore, Emily walks 196 - 150 = <<196-150=46>>46 meters farther every day.\nHence, Emily walks 46 x 5 = <<46*5=230>>230 meters farther in five days. Answer: \\boxed{230}.\n\n\nQuestion: Emily loves to have pets and for that reason, she has 4 dogs in her home. Each one eats 250 grams of food per day. She has to go on vacation for 14 days. How many kilograms of food should she buy for her 4 dogs so they don't starve while she is out?\n", "text": "Each dog eats 250 grams of food per day, so together they eat 4 * 250 = <<4*250=1000>>1000 grams of food per day.\nSince there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, Emily's dogs eat 1000 / 1000 = 1 kilogram of food per day.\nSo in 14 days, her 4 dogs would need 14 * 1 = <<14*1=14>>14 kilograms of food to avoid starving.
