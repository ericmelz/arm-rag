Esteban exercised for 10 minutes on each of nine days. How many hours did Natasha and Esteban exercise in total?\n\nNatasha: 30 minutes/day * 7 days = <<30*7=210>>210 minutes\nEsteban: 10 minutes/day * 9 days = <<10*9=90>>90 minutes\nTotal: 210 minutes + 90 minutes = <<210+90=300>>300 minutes\n300 minutes = <<300/60=5>>5 hours. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Natasha exercised for 30 minutes every day for one week. Esteban exercised for 10 minutes on each of nine days. How many hours did Natasha and Esteban exercise in total?\n\nNatasha exercised for 30 minutes x 7 days = <<30*7=210>>210 minutes.\nSo, she exercised for 210 / 60 = <<210/60=3.5>>3.5 hours.\nEsteban exercised for 10 minutes x 9 days = <<10*9=90>>90 minutes.\nSo, he exercised for 90 / 60 = <<90/60=1.5>>1.5 hours.\nTherefore, Natasha and Esteban exercised for a total of 3.5 + 1.5 = <<3.5+1.5=5>>5 hours. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Natasha exercised for 30 minutes every day for one week. Esteban exercised for 10 minutes on each of nine days. How many hours did Natasha and Esteban exercise in total?\n\nNatasha exercised for a total of 30 minutes/day x 7 days/week = <<30*7=210>>210 minutes in one week.\nEsteban exercised for a total of 10 minutes/day x 9 days/week = <<10*9=90>>90 minutes in one week.\nIn hours, Natasha and Esteban exercised a total of 210 minutes + 90 minutes = <<210+90=300>>300 minutes.\nIn hours, this is equal to 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<300/60=5>>5 hours. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Natasha exercised for 30 minutes every day for one week. Esteban exercised for 10 minutes on each of nine days. How many hours did Natasha and Esteban exercise in total?\n\nNatasha = (30 minutes/day) x 7 days = <<30*7=210>>210 minutes\nEsteban = (10 minutes/day) x 9 days = <<10*9=90>>90 minutes\nTotal = 210 + 90 = <<210+90=300>>300 minutes\nTotal = 300 minutes / (60 minutes/hour) = <<300/(60)=5>>5 hours.\nNatasha and Esteban exercised 5 hours in total.
