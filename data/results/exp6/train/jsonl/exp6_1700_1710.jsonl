How much money in total will Mike need to pay for the car, if he has to take $20000 from the bank?\n\nThe interest on the loan is 20000 * 15/100 = $<<20000*15/100=3000>>3000.\nSo Mike has to pay 35000 + 3000 = $<<35000+3000=38000>>38000.

To be able to pay this price, he needs to loan part of the money from the bank, at a rate of 15%. How much money in total will Mike need to pay for the car, if he has to take $20000 from the bank?\n\nThe loan from the bank is at a 15% rate, meaning Mike will have to pay $20000 * 15/100 = $<<20000*15/100=3000>>3000 interest.\nThe total price of the car will be $35000 + $3000 = $<<35000+3000=38000>>38000.

To be able to pay this price, he needs to loan part of the money from the bank, at a rate of 15%. How much money in total will Mike need to pay for the car, if he has to take $20000 from the bank?\n\nThe bank charges Mike at an interest rate of 15%, so 15/100 * 20000 = $<<15/100*20000=3000>>3000.\nSo the car will cost Mike a total of 35000 + 3000 = $<<35000+3000=38000>>38000.

To be able to pay this price, he needs to loan part of the money from the bank, at a rate of 15%. How much money in total will Mike need to pay for the car, if he has to take $20000 from the bank?\n\nThe bank will charge Mike an additional cost of 15/100 * $20000 = $<<15/100*20000=3000>>3000.\nSo for the car, he will have to pay a total cost of $35000 + $3000 = $<<35000+3000=38000>>38000.

How long will it take?\n\nMike saves 150,000*.1=$<<150000*.1=15000>>15,000 per year\nThat means he needs to save 450,000*.2=$<<450000*.2=90000>>90,000\nSo he needs to save for 90,000/15,000=6 years.

How many toys are there in Kamari's box?\n\nLet's say the number of toys Kamari has is x.\nAnais has x+30 toys.\nThe total number of toys is x+x+30 = 160.\nCombining like terms, we get 2x=160-30\nCombining like terms, we get 2x=130\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x=65 toys.

They score 25 2-pointers, which are worth 2 points each, so that is 25 * 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 points. They also score 8 3-pointers, which are worth 3 points each, so that is 8 * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 points.

In total, Mark's team scores 50 + 24 + 10 = <<50+24+10=84>>84 points.\n\nNow let's calculate the opponent's team's score. They score double the number of 2-pointers Mark's team scored, so that is 2 * 50 = <<2*50=100>>100 points. They score half the number of 3-pointers Mark's team scored, so that is 3 * 0.5 * 8 = <<3*0.5*8=12>>12 points. They also score half the number of free throws Mark's team scored, so that is 0.5 * 10 = <<0.5*10=5>>5 points. In total, the opponent's team scores 100 + 12 + 5 = <<100+12+5=117>>117 points.\n\nTo find the total number of points scored by both teams added together, we simply add Mark's team's score and the opponent's team's score: 84 + 117 = <<84+117=201>>201 points.
