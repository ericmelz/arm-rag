Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Ian won $100 in the lottery.  He decided to use the money to pay off debts. He paid $20 to Colin. He then paid twice as much to Helen, as he had paid to Colin. Then finally, he paid half as much to Benedict, as he had paid to Helen.  How much money, in dollars, does he have left after paying off debts?\n\nIan paid Helen twice as much as he paid Colin, so he paid her 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40 dollars\nBenedict received as half as much as Helen so he received 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 dollars\nIan's debts totaled 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 dollars\nHe therefore has 100-80 = <<100-80=20>>20 dollars remaining.

If the total sales price had a 25% discount, how much did Mrs. Taylor pay for the two televisions?\n\nEach television had a discount of 25/100 * $650 = $<<25/100*650=162.5>>162.5.\nSo each television cost $650 - $162.5 = $<<650-162.5=487.5>>487.5.\nThus, the total price of the two televisions was $487.5 x 2 = $<<487.5*2=975>>975. Answer: \\boxed{975}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mrs. Taylor bought two smart televisions that cost $650 each. If the total sales price had a 25% discount, how much did Mrs. Taylor pay for the two televisions?\n\nThe discount on each television is $650 x 25/100 = $<<650*25/100=162.5>>162.5.\nEach television costs $650 - $162.5 = $<<650-162.5=487.5>>487.5 after the discount.\nSo, Mrs. Taylor paid $487.5 x 2 = $<<487.5*2=975>>975 for the two televisions.

The pieces of candies come from blocks of candy, which each produce 30 pieces of candy. If Jan breaks down 3 blocks of candy and every single piece of candy from this is used in the candy necklaces, how many friends receive a candy necklace?\n\nJan has a total of 3 x 30 = <<3*30=90>>90 pieces of candy.\nThus, she can make a total of 90/10 = <<90/10=9>>9 candy necklaces.\nTherefore, Jan can give candy necklaces to 9 - 1 = <<9-1=8>>8 friends.
