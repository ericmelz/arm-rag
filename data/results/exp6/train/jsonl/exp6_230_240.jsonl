If the beakers are tested one by one for copper ions and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, how many beakers without copper ions were tested?\n\nThe number of beakers without copper ions that were tested can be found by subtracting the number of drops used on beakers with copper ions from the total number of drops used: 45 drops - (8 beakers * 3 drops/beaker) = 45 drops - 24 drops = <<45-(8*3)=21>>21 drops\n21 drops were used on beakers without copper ions.

If the beakers are tested one by one for copper ions and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, how many beakers without copper ions were tested?\n\nTo find the beakers without copper ions that were tested, we begin by finding the total number of beakers tested by dividing the number of drops used by the number of drops per beaker: 45 drops / 3 drops/beaker = <<45/3=15>>15 beakers\nThen subtract the number of beakers with copper ions that were tested to find the number of beakers without copper ions that were tested: 15 beakers - 8 beakers = <<15-8=7>>7 beakers.

If the beakers are tested one by one for copper ions and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, how many beakers without copper ions were tested?\n\nLet x be the number of beakers without copper ions tested.\nThe number of beakers tested is the sum of beakers with and without copper ions: x + 8 = 22.\nThe number of drops used is 3 per tested beaker: 3(x + 8) = 45.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x + 24 = 45.\nSubtracting 24 from both sides, we get 3x = 21.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 7.
