If she spent a total of two hours on these tasks, how long, in minutes, did she spend cleaning her room?\n\nIn minutes, two hours is equal to 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nThe total amount of time spent on the tasks excluding cleaning her room is 30 + 15 + 40 = <<30+15+40=85>>85 minutes.\nTherefore, she spent 120 - 85 = <<120-85=35>>35 minutes cleaning her room.

If she spent a total of two hours on these tasks, how long, in minutes, did she spend cleaning her room?\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour so Miriam spent 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes on these tasks.\nWe know from the question that the amount of time doing laundry was 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 40 minutes.\nWe can use this quantity and the total amount of time to find the time Miriam spent cleaning her room.\nThe equation that represents the total amount of time spent is:\nTotal time = Time doing laundry + Time cleaning bathroom + Time cleaning room + Time doing homework\nSubstituting in the known values, we see that 120 minutes = (30 minutes + 15 minutes + Time cleaning room + 40 minutes).\nCombining like terms, we have 120 minutes = (85 minutes + Time cleaning room).\nSubtracting 85 minutes from both sides of the equation, we get that Miriam spent Time cleaning room = 120 minutes - 85 minutes = <<120-85=35>>35 minutes.

On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\n\nLet's assume the number of students present in the class on the first day was x.\nThe number of students present in the class on the second day was x+40.\n\nThe number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day is twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day.\nIf 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick on the third day, then the number of students who didn't attend the class on the third day is 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40\n\nIf the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day is 40, then the number of students who didn't turn up on the second day is twice that number, or 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80.\n\nIn both of the two days, the total number of absentees is 40+80 = <<40+80=120>>120\nThe total number of students present on the first and second days is x+(x+40) = 2x+40\nSince the total number of students in the class is 280, the number of students present on the first and second days is 2x+40 = 280\n\nFrom the equation, 2x+40 = 280, the value of x is 280-40/2 = 240/2 = <<240/2=120>>120\nThe number of students absent on the first day is x, which is 120.\n\nThe total number of absentees in the three days is 120+120 = <<120+120=240>>240. Answer: \\boxed{240}.\n\n\nQuestion: Adam goes to a small school, which teaches 80 students in three classes. 40% of the students are in class A, and class B has 21 students fewer than class A. The rest are in class C. How many students are in this class?\n\nIn class A, there are 40/100 * 80 students = <<40/100*80=32>>32 students.\nIn class B, there are 32 students - 21 students = <<32-21=11>>11 students.\nSo in class C, there are 80 students - 32 students - 11 students = <<80-32-11=37>>37 students.

At the end of 4 years, how much money will be in Sheila\u2019s piggy bank?\n\nTo calculate the total amount of money in Sheila's piggy bank after 4 years, we need to consider her monthly savings and the additional secret contribution from her family.\n\nSheila saves $276 per month for 4 years, which is a total of $276 * 12 months * 4 years = $13,248.\n\nThe secret contribution from her family is $7,000.\n\nSo the total amount in Sheila's piggy bank after 4 years will be $13,248 + $7,000 + $3,000 = $23,248.
