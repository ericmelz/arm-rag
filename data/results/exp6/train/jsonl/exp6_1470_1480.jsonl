If she pays $15 per month, how much money did she borrow?\n\nLet X be the amount of money Yoque borrowed.\nThe additional amount she needs to pay back is X * 10/100 = 0.1*X.\nSo including the interest, the total amount she needs to pay back is X + 0.1*X = 1.1*X.\nShe will pay it back in 11 months, therefore she will pay 1.1*X / 11 = $15 per month.\nSo the amount she borrowed is X = $15 * 11 / 1.1 = $150.

Let X be the total amount she borrowed.\n\nTherefore, the amount she returned is 1/2 * X.\n\nSince the amount she borrowed is equal to the amount she returned plus the amount she will still owe her brother, we can set up the following equation:\n\nX = 1/2 * X + amount she will still owe her brother\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1/2 * X = amount she will still owe her brother\n\nTo find the amount she will still owe her brother, we need to find the value of 1/2 * X.\n\nSince Shara returned $10 per month and she returned half of the money she borrowed, that means she returned $10 * 6 = $<<10*6=60>>60 in total.\n\nWe know that $60 is equal to 1/2 * X, so we can solve for X:\n\n1/2 * X = $60\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\n\nX = $120\n\nTherefore, the total amount Shara borrowed is $120.\n\nSince Shara still owes her brother 1/2 * $120 = $60 and 4 months will pass, she will still owe her brother $60 - ($10 * 4) = $60 - $40 = $<<60-40=20>>20.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{20}."}

How much too much do the three children weigh together to cross the bridge?\n\nIf Kelly weighs 15% less than Megan, this means she weighs 100 - 15 = 85% of Megan's weight.\nThis means Kelly weighs 85/100 * Megan's weight = 0.85 * Megan's weight.\nWe're told that Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, so 0.85 * Megan's weight = 34 kilograms.\nWe need to divide both sides by 0.85 to find Megan's weight: Megan's weight = 34 kilograms / 0.85 = <<34/0.85=40>>40 kilograms.\nMike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan, so he weighs 40 kilograms + 5 kilograms = <<40+5=45>>45 kilograms.\nAltogether, the three children weigh 34 kilograms + 40 kilograms + 45 kilograms = <<34+40+45=119>>119 kilograms.\nTo cross the bridge all together, the three children are too heavy by 119 kilograms - 100 kilograms = <<119-100=19>>19 kilograms.

Answer: \\boxed{90}.\n\n\nQuestion: A small, old, wooden bridge can hold up to 100 kilograms at once. Mike, Megan, and Kelly are three children who decided to cross the bridge at the same time. Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, which is 15% less than Megan. Mike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan. How much too much do the three children weigh together to cross the bridge?\n", "text": "If Kelly weighs 34 kilograms, which is 15% less than Megan, then Megan weighs 34 / (1 - 15/100) = 40 kilograms.\nMike weighs 5 kilograms more than Megan, so he weighs 40 + 5 = 45 kilograms.\nSo the three children weigh together 34 + 40 + 45 = 119 kilograms.\nTherefore, the three children weigh too much by 119 - 100 = 19 kilograms. Answer: \\boxed{19}."}
