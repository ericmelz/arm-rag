If each yard of fabric costs $2 and each yard of yarn costs $3, how much does he earn from Monday to Wednesday?\n\nEvery Monday Daniel earns 20 x $2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nEvery Tuesday he delivers 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 yards of fabric.\nSo every Tuesday he earns 40 x $2 = $<<40*2=80>>80.\nEvery Wednesday he delivers 40/4 = <<40/4=10>>10 yards of fabric.\nSo every Wednesday he earns 10 x $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nTherefore, he earns $40 + $80 + $20 = $<<40+80+20=140>>140 from Monday to Wednesday.
