Bob invests in real estate and makes five times more money than he invested. How much more money does Bob have now than Alice?\n", "text": "Alice doubles her money, so she now has 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.\nBob makes 5 times more money than he invested, so he makes 5 * $2000 = $<<5*2000=10000>>10000.\nThis means Bob has a total of $2000 + $10000 = $<<2000+10000=12000>>12000.\nTherefore, Bob has $12000 - $4000 = $<<12000-4000=8000>>8000 more than Alice. Answer: \\boxed{8000}."}
