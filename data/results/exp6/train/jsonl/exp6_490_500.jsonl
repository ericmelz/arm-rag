If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\n\nLet the length of the third side be x cm.\nThe perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all sides of the triangle, which is 40 + 50 + x = 160 cm.\nCombining like terms gives 90 + x = 160 cm.\nSubtracting 90 from both sides gives x = 160 - 90 = <<160-90=70>>70 cm\nThe length of the third side is 70 cm. Answer: \\boxed{70}.\n\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\n\nLet's assume the third side is x cm.\nThe perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides, so:\n40 cm + 50 cm + x cm = 160 cm\nAdding the two known sides gives: 90 cm + x cm = 160 cm\nSubtracting 90 cm from both sides gives: x cm = 160 cm - 90 cm = <<160-90=70>>70 cm\nThe length of the third side is 70 cm. Answer: \\boxed{70}.\n\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\n\nLet's assume that the length of the third side is \"x\".\n\nBy the definition of perimeter, the perimeter of a triangle is given by the sum of the lengths of its three sides.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the triangle is x + 40 + 50.\n\nAlso, it's given that the perimeter is 160 cm.\n\nTherefore, x + 40 + 50 = 160.\n\nCombining like terms, we get x + 90 = 160.\n\nBy subtracting 90 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 160 - 90 = 70.\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 70 cm. Answer: \\boxed{70}.\n\n\nQuestion: In a triangle with angles A, B, and C, A is 60 degrees, and B is two times as big as C. Calculate the angle of B.\n\nLet C be the angle of C.\nThe total angle sum in a triangle is 180 degrees.\nSo A + B + C = 180 degrees.\nSince A is 60 degrees, we have:\n60 + B + C = 180.\nSubstituting B = 2C, we have:\n60 + 2C + C = 180.\nCombining like terms, we get:\n3C + 60 = 180.\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get:\n3C = 120.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nC = 40.\nTherefore, the angle B is 2C = 2 * 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{80}.\n\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm.

If he has now used all of the matchsticks he intended to and each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, how many matchsticks did Michael have originally?\n\nMichael has used 30 * 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 matchsticks.\nSo, he initially had 300 * 2 = <<300*2=600>>600 matchsticks.

If he has now used all of the matchsticks he intended to and each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, how many matchsticks did Michael have originally?\n\nIf 30 matchstick houses use 10 matchsticks per house, there were 30*10 = <<30*10=300>>300 matchsticks used.\nSince Michael only used half of his matchsticks, he therefore had 2*300 = <<2*300=600>>600 matchsticks initially.
