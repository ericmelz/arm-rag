Answer: \\boxed{26}.\n\n\nQuestion: A row of houses all share a community space where they put up their clotheslines. There are 2 clotheslines for every house on the street. On the street, there are a total of 11 children and 20 adults. Each child currently has 4 items of clothing on the clotheslines and each adult currently has 3 items of clothing on the clotheslines. If each clothesline can hold 2 items of clothing and all of the clotheslines are full, how many houses are on the street?\n\nFirst find the total number of children's clothes on the lines: 11 children * 4 items/child = <<11*4=44>>44 items\nThen find the total number of adult clothes on the lines: 20 adults * 3 items/adult = <<20*3=60>>60 items\nThen add the number of each kind of item to find the total number of items: 60 items + 44 items = <<60+44=104>>104 items\nThen divide the total number of items by the number of items per line to find the number of lines: 104 items / 2 items/line = <<104/2=52>>52 lines\nThen divide the number of lines by the number of lines per house to find the number of houses: 52 lines / 2 lines/house = <<52/2=26>>26 houses.

On the street, there are a total of 11 children and 20 adults. Each child currently has 4 items of clothing on the clotheslines and each adult currently has 3 items of clothing on the clotheslines. If each clothesline can hold 2 items of clothing and all of the clotheslines are full, how many houses are on the street?\n", "text": "First, let's find the total number of children's clothing items on the clotheslines. There are 11 children, and each child has 4 items of clothing, so there are 11 * 4 = <<11*4=44>>44 children's clothing items.\n\nNext, let's find the total number of adult clothing items on the clotheslines. There are 20 adults, and each adult has 3 items of clothing, so there are 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 adult clothing items.\n\nTo find the total number of items on the clotheslines, we can add the number of children's clothing items to the number of adult clothing items, which gives us 44 + 60 = <<44+60=104>>104 items.\n\nSince each clothesline can hold 2 items of clothing, we can divide the total number of items by 2 to find the number of clotheslines. 104 items / 2 items per clothesline = 52 clotheslines.\n\nSince there are 2 clotheslines for every house, we can divide the number of clotheslines by 2 to find the number of houses. 52 clotheslines / 2 clotheslines per house = <<52/2=26>>26 houses.\n\nTherefore, there are 26 houses on the street.
