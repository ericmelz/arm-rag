How many combined feet did the friends walk?\n", "text": "To find the combined feet that the friends walked, we need to convert each distance to feet and then add them together. \n\nLionel walked 4 miles, so we multiply 4 by 5280 since there are 5280 feet in a mile. This gives us 4 * 5280 = 21120 feet.\n\nEsther walked 975 yards, so we multiply 975 by 3 since there are 3 feet in a yard. This gives us 975 * 3 = 2925 feet.\n\nNiklaus walked 1287 feet.\n\nTo find the combined feet, we add all three distances: 21120 feet + 2925 feet + 1287 feet = 25332 feet.\n\nTherefore, the friends walked a combined total of 25332 feet.
