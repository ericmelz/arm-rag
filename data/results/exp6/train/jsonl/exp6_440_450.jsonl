Answer: \\boxed{65}.\n\n\nQuestion: Megan has read 32 books this year.  Kelcie has read 1/4 the amount of books that Megan has read.  Greg has read 9 more than twice the number of books that Kelcie has read.  How many books total have Megan, Kelcie, and Greg read?\n", "text": "Kelcie has read 1/4 of the amount of books Megan has read, so she has read 1/4 * 32 = <<1/4*32=8>>8 books.\nGreg has read 9 more than twice the number of books Kelcie has read, so he has read 9 + 2 * 8 = <<9+2*8=25>>25 books.\nTherefore, Megan, Kelcie, and Greg have read a total of 32 + 8 + 25 = <<32+8+25=65>>65 books. \nAnswer: \\boxed{65}."}
