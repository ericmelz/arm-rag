Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: The age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas. Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys who is 30 years old now. How old will Lucas be three years from now?\n\nBilly's current age is 30 / 3 = <<30/3=10>>10 years old.\nThe sum of Billy and Lucas's ages is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.\nSo, Lucas is 15 - 10 = <<15-10=5>>5 years old.\nTherefore, Lucas will be 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 years old three years from now. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4. Mark is four years older than Billy. Billy is half Ana's age. If Ana will be 15 in 3 years, how old is Sarah?\n\nCurrently, Ana is 15 - 3 = <<15-3=12>>12 years old.\nBilly is 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 years old.\nMark is 6 + 4 = <<6+4=10>>10 years old.\nSarah is 3 * 10 - 4 = <<3*10-4=26>>26 years old.

If Phil won a total of 12 games, how many more games did Perry win than did Phil?\n\nSince Phil won a total of 12 games, and that was three more than Charlie did, then Charlie won only 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9 games.\nIf Charlie won 9 games, 2 games fewer than Dana, then Dana won 2+9=<<2+9=11>>11 games.\nIf Perry won five more games than Dana, then Perry won 11+5=<<11+5=16>>16 games.\nThus, Perry won 16-12=<<16-12=4>>4 more games than did Phil.
