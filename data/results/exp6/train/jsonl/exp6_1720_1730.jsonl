If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\n\nLet X be the original price.\nThe discount her original price is X - X*.2 = .8*X\nSo she paid X - X*.2 = $480.\nThus X - X*.2 = $480.\nThus X*.8 = $480.\nSo X = $480 / .8 = $<<480/.8=600>>600.

If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\n\nLet X be the original price\nSo the discount was X*.2=$<<X*.2=0.2X>>0.2X\nSo the final price was X-0.20X=$480.00\nSo 0.80X=$480.00\nSo X=$<<600=600>>600.

If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\n\nLet x be the original price of the pair of shoes.\nAfter the discount, she paid x - x*(20/100) = $480.\nCombining like terms, we get x - 0.20x = $480.\nCombining like terms, we get 0.80x = $480.\nDividing both sides by 0.80, we get x = $<<600=600>>600.

If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\n\nLet X be the original price of the pair of shoes.\nThe discount is 20/100 * X = $<<20/100*X=0.2X>>0.2X\nThe current price is X - 0.2X = $<<X-0.2*X=0.8*X>>0.8X\nWe know that 0.8X = $480\nSo the original price was X = $480 / (0.8) = $<<480/(0.8)=600>>600.

If the school has 300 students, how many students are non-foreign male students?\n\nOut of the 300 students, 2/3 x 300 = <<2/3*300=200>>200 students are females.\nSo, 300 - 200 = <<300-200=100>>100 students are males.\nOut of the 100 males, 1/10 x 100 = <<1/10*100=10>>10 are foreign students.\nThus, 100 - 10 = <<100-10=90>>90 students are non-foreign male students.

If the school has 300 students, how many students are non-foreign male students?\n\nThere are 300 x 2/3 = <<300*2/3=200>>200 females at the school.\nThere are 300 - 200 = <<300-200=100>>100 males at the school.\nThere are 100 x 1/10 = <<100*1/10=10>>10 foreign male students at the school.\nHence, there are 100 - 10 = <<100-10=90>>90 non-foreign male students at the school. Answer: \\boxed{90}.\n\n\nQuestion: In a school with 800 students, 5/8 of the students are girls. Seven-tenths of the girls and two-fifths of the boys are in the primary grades, while the rest are middle schoolers. How many middle schoolers are there?\n\nThe number of girls in the school is 5/8 * 800 students = <<5/8*800=500>>500 students\nOut of these girls, 7/10 * 500 students = <<7/10*500=350>>350 students are in primary grades.\nSo, 500 - 350 = <<500-350=150>>150 of them are middle schoolers.\nThe number of boys in the school is 800 students - 500 students = <<800-500=300>>300 students.\nOut of these boys, 2/5 * 300 students = <<2/5*300=120>>120 students are in primary grades.\nHence, 300 - 120 = <<300-120=180>>180 boys are middle schoolers.\nTherefore, the total number of middle schoolers is 180 boys + 150 girls = <<180+150=330>>330 middle schoolers. Answer: \\boxed{330}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a certain school, 2/3 of the population are females. One-tenth of the males are foreign students.
