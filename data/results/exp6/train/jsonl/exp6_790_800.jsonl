She needs to have 6 appetizers per each of her 30 guests.  She\u2019s making 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket and 2 dozen kebabs.  How many more dozen appetizers does she need to make?\n\nShe needs a total of 6 appetizers per guest * 30 guests = <<6*30=180>>180 appetizers.\n1 dozen is equal to 12 appetizers, so 180 appetizers / 12 appetizers = <<180/12=15>>15 dozen appetizers.\nShe has already made a total of 3 dozen deviled eggs + 2 dozen pigs in the blanket + 2 dozen kebobs = <<3+2+2=7>>7 dozen of appetizers.\nTherefore, she still needs to make 15 - 7 = <<15-7=8>>8 dozen appetizers more.

How many more dozen appetizers does she need to make?\n\nPatsy needs a total of 6 appetizers per guest x 30 guests = <<6*30=180>>180 appetizers.\nShe already has 3 dozen deviled eggs x 12 eggs = <<3*12=36>>36 deviled eggs.\nShe also has 2 dozen pigs in a blanket x 12 pigs = <<2*12=24>>24 pigs in a blanket.\nShe has 2 dozen kebabs x 12 kebabs = <<2*12=24>>24 kebabs.\nHer total number of appetizers is 36 eggs + 24 pigs + 24 kebabs = <<36+24+24=84>>84 appetizers.\nTherefore, she still needs to make 180 appetizers \u2013 84 appetizers = <<180-84=96>>96 appetizers.\nSince there are 12 appetizers in a dozen, this means she still needs to make 96 appetizers / 12 appetizers = <<96/12=8>>8 more dozen appetizers. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Angela is a bike messenger in New York. She needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. If she needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined, how many meals does she deliver?\n\nLet's say the number of meals Angela delivers is m, and the number of packages she delivers is p.\nWe know that m + p = 27, and p = 8m (since she delivers 8 times as many packages as meals).\nSubstituting the value of p from the second equation into the first equation, we get: m + 8m = 27\nCombining like terms, we get: 9m = 27\nDividing both sides by 9, we get: m = 27 / 9 = <<27/9=3>>3\nTherefore, Angela delivers 3 meals.
