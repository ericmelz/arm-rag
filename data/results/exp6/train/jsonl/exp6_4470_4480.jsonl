The list included a carton of milk for $4.00, a loaf of bread for $3.50, a box of laundry detergent for $10.25 and 2 pounds of bananas that were $0.75 per pound.  Her mom also gave her a coupon for $1.25 off of the laundry detergent.  At checkout, the clerk told her the milk was 1/2 off today.  How much money did Josie have left over after she bought all of the groceries?\n\nThe laundry detergent cost $10.25 but she had a coupon for $1.25 off so it cost 10.25-1.25 = $<<10.25-1.25=9.00>>9.00\nThe bananas are $0.75 a pound and she bought 2 pounds so they cost .75*2 = $<<.75*2=1.50>>1.50\nThe milk was on sale for half off and it is $4.00 so it is now 4*.50 = $<<4*.50=2.00>>2.00\nThe milk is $2.00, bread is $3.50, detergent is $9.00 and bananas are $1.50 so all total, she spent 2+3.50+9+1.50 = $<<2+3.50+9+1.50=16.00>>16.00\nShe was given a $20 bill and spent $16.00 so she has 20-16 = $<<20-16=4.00>>4.00 left.

His friend Terry took 8 bushels, while Jerry only took 3. He gave 12 bushels to his friend Linda, who runs a food pantry. His neighbor Stacy doesn't eat much corn, but she still accepted 21 ears of corn from him. If each bushel contained 14 ears of corn, how many ears of corn does Bob have left?\n\nBob gave Terry 8 bushels * 14 ears of corn per bushel = <<8*14=112>>112 ears of corn.\nHe gave Jerry 3 bushels * 14 ears of corn per bushel = <<3*14=42>>42 ears of corn.\nLinda took 12 bushels * 14 ears of corn per bushel = <<12*14=168>>168 ears of corn.\nHe had a total of 50 bushels * 14 ears of corn per bushel = <<50*14=700>>700 ears of corn.\nThus, Bob has 700 ears of corn - 112 ears of corn - 42 ears of corn - 168 ears of corn - 21 ears of corn = <<700-112-42-168-21=357>>357 ears of corn remaining.

Farmer Brenda grows 6 acres of corn, 7 acres of cotton, and 14 acres of beans. Farmer Bernie grows 2 acres of corn and 12 acres of cotton. If corn takes 20 gallons of water an acre, cotton takes 80 gallons of water an acre, and beans take twice as much water as corn, what percentage of the total water used will go to Farmer Bob's farm?\n\nFirst find the total water Bob's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 3 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<3*20=60>>60 gallons\nThen find the total water Bob's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 9 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<9*80=720>>720 gallons\nThen find the total water Bob's beans will use by multiplying the beans' water use per acre by the number of acres: 12 acres * 2 * 20 gallons/acre = <<12*2*20=480>>480 gallons\nThen add all three amounts of water used to find the total: 60 gallons + 720 gallons + 480 gallons = <<60+720+480=1260>>1260 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 6 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<6*20=120>>120 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 7 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<7*80=560>>560 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's beans will use by multiplying the beans' water use per acre by the number of acres: 14 acres * 2 * 20 gallons/acre = <<14*2*20=560>>560 gallons\nThen add all three amounts of water used to find the total: 120 gallons + 560 gallons + 560 gallons = <<120+560+560=1240>>1240 gallons\nThen find the total water Bernie's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 2 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<2*20=40>>40 gallons\nThen find the total water Bernie's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 12 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<12*80=960>>960 gallons\nThen add both amounts of water to find the total: 40 gallons + 960 gallons = <<40+960=1000>>1000 gallons\nThen add the totals from all three farmers to find the overall total water used: 1000 gallons + 1240 gallons + 1260 gallons = <<1000+1240+1260=3500>>3500 gallons\nThen divide the amount of water Bob uses by the total water used and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1260 gallons / 3500 gallons * 100% = 36%.

His friend Bob would like to eat one more piece than George.  Susie will eat half as many as Bob.  Bill, Fred and Mark would each like 3 pieces.  How many slices of pizza will be left over?\n\nThree small pizzas give 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 slices.\nTwo large pizzas give 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 slices.\nGeorge wants to eat 3, Bob would like to eat 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 pieces.\nSusie would like to eat 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 pieces.\nBill, Fred and Mark each want to eat 3 pieces for a total of 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 pieces.\nThe small pizzas give 12 slices, the large pizza gives 16 slices, George wants 3, Bob wants 4, Susie wants 2 and the other three want 9 so there are 12+16-3-4-2-9=<<12+16-3-4-2-9=10>>10 slices left.

If corn takes 20 gallons of water an acre, cotton takes 80 gallons of water an acre, and beans take twice as much water as corn, what percentage of the total water used will go to Farmer Bob's farm?\n\nFirst figure out how much water is used by one acre of beans: 20 gallons/acre * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 gallons/acre\nNow find the total water used by Farmer Bob's corn: 20 gallons/acre * 3 acres = <<20*3=60>>60 gallons\nNow find the total water used by Farmer Bob's cotton: 80 gallons/acre * 9 acres = <<80*9=720>>720 gallons\nNow find the total water used by Farmer Bob's beans: 40 gallons/acre * 12 acres = <<40*12=480>>480 gallons\nNow find the total amount of water used by Farmer Bob: 60 gallons + 720 gallons + 480 gallons = <<60+720+480=1260>>1260 gallons\nNow do the same thing for Farmer Brenda: 20 gallons/acre * 6 acres = <<20*6=120>>120 gallons of corn\n80 gallons/acre * 7 acres = <<80*7=560>>560 gallons of cotton\n40 gallons/acre * 14 acres = <<40*14=560>>560 gallons of beans\n120 gallons + 560 gallons + 560 gallons = <<120+560+560=1240>>1240 gallons of water\nAnd do the same thing for Farmer Bernie: 20 gallons/acre * 2 acres = <<20*2=40>>40 gallons of corn\n80 gallons/acre * 12 acres = <<80*12=960>>960 gallons of cotton\n40 + 960 = <<40+960=1000>>1000 gallons\nNow find the total amount of water used: 1260 gallons + 1240 gallons + 1000 gallons = <<1260+1240+1000=3500>>3500 gallons\nNow divide the amount of water Farmer Bob's plants use by the total amount of water: 1260 gallons / 3500 gallons = 0.36\nNow convert that proportion to a percentage: 0.36 * 100 = <<0.36*100=36>>36%.
