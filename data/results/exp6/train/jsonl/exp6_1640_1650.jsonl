How many passengers fit in 5 buses?\n\nIf 198 passengers fit into 9 buses, then the ratio of passengers to buses is 198/9 = 22 passengers per bus.\nTherefore, in 5 buses, there would be 22 * 5 = <<22*5=110>>110 passengers. Answer: \\boxed{110}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two buses leave a pick-up point station with 60% and 70% of capacity full, respectively. If the people in the buses are all employees of a company, and the buses have a capacity of 150, calculate the total number of the employees in the two buses combined?\n\nIf the first bus is 60% full, it has 60/100 * 150 passengers = <<60/100*150=90>>90 passengers.\nSince the second bus has a 70% capacity full, it carries 70/100 * 150 passengers = <<70/100*150=105>>105 passengers.\nThe total number of employees in the two buses is 105 passengers + 90 passengers = <<105+90=195>>195 passengers.

Sarah says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 10 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors, she saw her reflection 5 times. Ellie says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 6 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors she saw her reflection 3 times. They both passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each and they both passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each. In total, how many times did Sarah and Ellie see their reflections?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of reflections Sarah saw in the room with tall mirrors. Sarah saw her reflection 10 times every time they were in a room with tall mirrors and they passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each, so Sarah saw her reflection in tall mirrors a total of 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 times.\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of reflections Sarah saw in the room with wide mirrors. Sarah saw her reflection 5 times every time they were in a room with wide mirrors and they passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each, so Sarah saw her reflection in wide mirrors a total of 5 * 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 times.\nAdding these two totals together, we find that in total, Sarah saw her reflection 30 + 25 = <<30+25=55>>55 times.\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of reflections Ellie saw in the room with tall mirrors. Ellie saw her reflection 6 times every time they were in a room with tall mirrors and they passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each, so Ellie saw her reflection in tall mirrors a total of 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 times.\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of reflections Ellie saw in the room with wide mirrors. Ellie saw her reflection 3 times every time they were in a room with wide mirrors and they passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each, so Ellie saw her reflection in wide mirrors a total of 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times.\nAdding these two totals together, we find that in total, Ellie saw her reflection 18 + 15 = <<18+15=33>>33 times.\nAdding the total number of times Ellie and Sarah saw their reflections together, we find that Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections 55 + 33 = <<55+33=88>>88 times.
