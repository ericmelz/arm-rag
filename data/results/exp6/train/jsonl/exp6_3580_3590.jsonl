He plans to travel 200 miles. How many hours faster is the bigger sail than the smaller one?\n\nFirst find the total time it takes Danny to travel 200 miles with the bigger sail: 200 miles / 50 miles/hour = <<200/50=4>>4 hours\nThen find the total time it takes Danny to travel 200 miles with the smaller sail: 200 miles / 20 miles/hour = <<200/20=10>>10 hours\nThen subtract the smaller travel time from the bigger travel time to find the difference: 10 hours - 4 hours = <<10-4=6>>6 hours. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Danny is bringing his sailboat out to the ocean. When he uses his 24 square foot sail he goes 50 MPH. When he uses his 12 square foot sail he goes 20 MPH. He plans to travel 200 miles.

How many hours faster is the bigger sail than the smaller one?\n", "text": "To calculate the time it takes for Danny to travel 200 miles with the bigger sail, we divide the distance by the speed: 200 miles / 50 mph = 4 hours.\nSimilarly, for the smaller sail, we divide the distance by the speed: 200 miles / 20 mph = 10 hours.\nTherefore, the bigger sail is 10 - 4 = 6 hours faster than the smaller sail. Answer: \\boxed{6}."}
