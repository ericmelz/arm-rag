She runs the circuit 7 times in the morning and runs it 3 times in the afternoon. How many meters does Isabel run during a week?\n\nIn the morning Isabel runs 365 m/circuit * 7 circuits/morning = <<365*7=2555>>2555 m in the morning.\nIn the afternoon Isabel runs 365 m/circuit * 3 circuits/afternoon = <<365*3=1095>>1095 m in the afternoon.\nOn a daily basis, Isabel runs 2555 m + 1095 m = <<2555+1095=3650>>3650 m.\nIn a week she runs 3650 m/day * 7 days/week = <<3650*7=25550>>25550 meters.
