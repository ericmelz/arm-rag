He makes the round trip to school two times (when taking the children to school and when bringing them back) every day for 4 days a week. Then he makes a round trip to the market once during weekends. What is his car's mileage for a typical week?\n\nThe total mileage for the trip to the school and back is 2.5 miles * 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 miles.\nIn a week, he makes this trip 4 days/week * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 times.\nSo the total mileage for the trips to the school is 5 miles/trip * 8 trips/week = <<5*8=40>>40 miles/week.\nThe total mileage for the trip to the market is 2 miles * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 miles.\nIn a week, he makes this trip once, so the total mileage for the trips to the market is 4 miles/trip * 1 trip/week = <<4*1=4>>4 miles/week.\nTherefore, his car's mileage for a typical week is 40 miles/week + 4 miles/week = <<40+4=44>>44 miles/week.

He makes the round trip to school two times (when taking the children to school and when bringing them back) every day for 4 days a week. Then he makes a round trip to the market once during weekends. What is his car's mileage for a typical week?\n\nThe total mileage for one round trip to the school is 2.5 miles + 2.5 miles = <<2.5+2.5=5>>5 miles.\nSo, the mileage spent on taking the children to school per day is 5 miles x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles.\nTherefore, the total mileage for taking them to school per week is 10 miles x 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 miles.\nThe mileage for one round trip to the market is 2 miles + 2 miles = <<2+2=4>>4 miles.\nTherefore, his mileage for one week is 40 miles + 4 miles = <<40+4=44>>44 miles.

During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.

In total he has 150 hectares of land. 25 hectares are occupied by his house and farm machinery, and 15 hectares have been reserved for future expansion. 40 hectares are dedicated to rearing cattle. Assuming the rest of his land is used for crops, how many hectares of land does Job use for crop production?\n\nWe know that the total land area that Job has is 150 hectares.\nOut of this, he has used 25 hectares for his house and farm machinery, and 15 hectares for future expansion.\nSo the total area used for house, machinery, and future expansion is 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 hectares.\nHe also uses 40 hectares for rearing cattle.\nTherefore, the total area used for house, machinery, future expansion, and rearing cattle is 40 + 40 = <<40+40=80>>80 hectares.\nHence, Job uses 150 - 80 = <<150-80=70>>70 hectares for crop production.

In total he has 150 hectares of land. 25 hectares are occupied by his house and farm machinery, and 15 hectares have been reserved for future expansion. 40 hectares are dedicated to rearing cattle. Assuming the rest of his land is used for crops, how many hectares of land does Job use for crop production?\n\nIf 25 hectares are occupied by his house and farm machinery, and 15 hectares have been reserved for future expansion, then the total area occupied by the house, farm machinery, and lands reserved for expansion is 25 hectares + 15 hectares = <<25+15=40>>40 hectares.\nIf 40 hectares are dedicated to rearing cattle, and the total area occupied by the house, farm machinery, and lands reserved for expansion is 40 hectares, then the land used for crop production is 150 hectares - 40 hectares - 40 hectares = <<150-40-40=70>>70 hectares.

Farmer Brenda grows 6 acres of corn, 7 acres of cotton, and 14 acres of beans. Farmer Bernie grows 2 acres of corn and 12 acres of cotton. If corn takes 20 gallons of water an acre, cotton takes 80 gallons of water an acre, and beans take twice as much water as corn, what percentage of the total water used will go to Farmer Bob's farm?\n\nFirst find the total water Bob's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 3 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<3*20=60>>60 gallons\nThen find the total water Bob's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 9 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<9*80=720>>720 gallons\nThen find the total water Bob's beans will use by multiplying the beans' water use per acre by the number of acres: 12 acres * 2 * 20 gallons/acre = <<12*2*20=480>>480 gallons\nThen add all three amounts of water used to find the total: 60 gallons + 720 gallons + 480 gallons = <<60+720+480=1260>>1260 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 6 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<6*20=120>>120 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 7 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<7*80=560>>560 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's beans will use by multiplying the beans' water use per acre by the number of acres: 14 acres * 2 * 20 gallons/acre = <<14*2*20=560>>560 gallons\nThen add all three amounts of water used to find the total: 120 gallons + 560 gallons + 560 gallons = <<120+560+560=1240>>1240 gallons\nThen find the total water Bernie's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 2 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<2*20=40>>40 gallons\nThen find the total water Bernie's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 12 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<12*80=960>>960 gallons\nThen add both amounts of water to find the total: 40 gallons + 960 gallons = <<40+960=1000>>1000 gallons\nThen add the totals from all three farmers to find the overall total water used: 1000 gallons + 1240 gallons + 1260 gallons = <<1000+1240+1260=3500>>3500 gallons\nThen divide the amount of water Bob uses by the total water used and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1260 gallons / 3500 gallons * 100% = 36%.

Out of this, 25 hectares are occupied by his house and farm machinery, and 15 hectares have been reserved for future expansion. Therefore, the total area used for house and expansion is 25 + 15 = 40 hectares. Job also uses 40 hectares for rearing cattle. \n\nTo find the area used for crop production, we can subtract the total area used for house, expansion, and cattle from the total land area. \n\nTherefore, Job uses 150 - 40 - 40 = 70 hectares of land for crop production.
