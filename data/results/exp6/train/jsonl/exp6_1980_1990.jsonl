Answer: \\boxed{132}.\n\n\nQuestion: Samuel has $5, $10, and $20 bills which amount to $150 in his wallet. His $10-bills amount to $50, and he has 4 $20-bills. How many bills does Samuel have in his wallet?\n\nSamuel has $10 x 5 = $<<10*5=50>>50 for his $10-bills.\nSo Samuel has $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80 for his $20-bills.\nTherefore, Samuel has a total of $50 + $80 = $<<50+80=130>>130 for his $10- and $20-bills.\nHence, Samuel has $150 - $130 = $<<150-130=20>>20 for his $5-bills.\nTherefore, Samuel has $20/$5 = <<20/5=4>>4 $5-bills.\nTherefore, Samuel has 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 $5 and $20-bills.\nTherefore, Samuel has 8 + 5 = <<8+5=13>>13 $5, $10, and $20-bills. Answer: \\boxed{13}.\n\n\nQuestion: $240 was divided between Kelvin and Samuel. Samuel received 3/4 of the money. From his share, Samuel then spent 1/5 of the original $240 on drinks.

After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have?\n\nJohn starts with 3 half-full decks of cards, so there are half of 52 cards per deck which is 52 / 2 = <<52/2=26>>26 cards in each half-full deck.\nIf there are 3 half-full decks, then John has 26 * 3 = <<26*3=78>>78 cards from the half-full decks.\nHe also has 3 full decks, which is 3 * 52 = <<3*52=156>>156 cards from the three full decks.\nHe then throws away 34 of the cards, so now he has a total of 78 + 156 - 34 = <<78+156-34=200>>200 cards. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: Marcus takes a deck of standard playing cards and takes out all the face cards and the 8's. Mark picks a card at random and then replaces it 36 times. How many times should he expect to pick a card that's both red and has a number divisible by 3?\n\nAfter removing the face cards and 8's, there are 4 suits * 9 numbers = <<4*9=36>>36 cards in the deck.\nThere are 2 red suits * 3 numbers divisible by 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 cards that are both red and divisible by 3.\nThus, the probability of picking a red card that's divisible by 3 is 6/36 = <<6/36=1/6>>1/6.\nMark is replacing the card each time, so each time he picks a card, it is an independent event.\nTherefore, the expected number of times he should pick a red card divisible by 3 is 36 * 1/6 = <<36*1/6=6>>6.
