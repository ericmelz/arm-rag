If its original volume is 500cm\u00b3, what will its volume be after 2 hours underwater?\n", "text": "After 1 hour underwater, the balloon's volume increases by 2/5 * 500cm\u00b3 = 200cm\u00b3.\nTherefore, the balloon's volume after the first hour underwater is 500cm\u00b3 + 200cm\u00b3 = 700cm\u00b3.\nIn the second hour underwater, the balloon's volume increases by 2/5 * 700cm\u00b3 = 280cm\u00b3.\nTherefore, the balloon's volume after the second hour underwater is 700cm\u00b3 + 280cm\u00b3 = 980cm\u00b3. Answer: \\boxed{980}."}
