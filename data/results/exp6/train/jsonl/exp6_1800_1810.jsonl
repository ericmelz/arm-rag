The remaining students are divided into two equal groups, only one of which is physically in school on any day. What percent of students are present in school?\n\nIf 40 percent of students have elected to learn from home, then 100 - 40 = 60 percent of students remain.\nThis remaining 60 percent is divided into two equal groups, meaning each group represents 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 percent of students.\nTherefore, 30 percent of students are physically present in school on any given day.

The rest of the students don't eat lunch. If 10 students eat in the school cafeteria, how many don't eat lunch?\n\nThe number of students who bring their lunch is 3 * 10 students = <<3*10=30>>30 students\nSo the number of students who don't eat lunch is 60 students - 30 students - 10 students = <<60-30-10=20>>20 students.

The rest of the students don't eat lunch. If 10 students eat in the school cafeteria, how many don't eat lunch?\n\nThe total number of students who bring their lunch is 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 kids.\nSo, the number of students who eat lunch is 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40 kids.\nTherefore, 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 students don't eat lunch. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mr. McNeely takes a register of the total number of students present in class every day. On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\n\nLet's assume the number of students present in the class on the first day was x.\nThe number of students present in the class on the second day was x+40.\n\nThe number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day is twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day.\nIf 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick on the third day, then the number of students who didn't attend the class on the third day is 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40\n\nIf the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day is 40, then the number of students who didn't turn up on the second day is twice that number, or 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80.\n\nIn both of the two days, the total number of absentees is 40+80 = <<40+80=120>>120\nThe total number of students present on the first and second days is x+(x+40) = 2x+40\nSince the total number of students in the class is 280, the number of students present on the first and second days is 2x+40 = 280\n\nFrom the equation, 2x+40 = 280, the value of x is 280-40/2 = 240/2 = <<240/2=120>>120\nThe number of students absent on the first day is x, which is 120.\n\nThe total number of absentees in the three days is 120+120 = <<120+120=240>>240.

Answer: \\boxed{91}.\n\n\nQuestion: Malou got 91, 90, and 92 in her three quizzes. What is her average score?\n\nTo find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of quizzes. In this case, she got 91, 90, and 92 in three quizzes, so the average score is (91 + 90 + 92) / 3 = 273 / 3 = 91. Malou's average score is 91. Answer: \\boxed{91}.\n\n\nQuestion: Brittany got a 78 on her first test. After her second test, her average rose to an 81. What grade did she get on her second test?\n\nLet T be the grade Brittany got on her second test.\nHer average after the second test is (78 + T)/2 = 81.\n78 + T = 162\nT = <<84=84>>84. Answer: \\boxed{84}.\n\n\nQuestion: Brittany got a 78 on her first test. After her second test, her average rose to an 81. What grade did she get on her second test?\n\nLet x be the grade she got on her second test.\nHer total score from the two tests is x + 78.\nHer average is (x + 78)/2 = 81.\nThus, x + 78 = 2 * 81 = 162.\nTherefore, x = 162 - 78 = <<162-78=84>>84.\nBrittany got an 84 on her second test. Answer: \\boxed{84}.\n\n\nQuestion: Maria's test scores are 80, 70, and 90. What score does she need to get on a fourth test so that her average score for the four tests is exactly 85?\n\nMaria's total score on her first three tests is 80 + 70 + 90 = <<80+70+90=240>>240.\nTo average 85 on four tests, Maria needs a total score of 4 \u00d7 85 = <<4*85=340>>340.\nMaria needs to score 340 - 240 = <<340-240=100>>100 on the fourth test.
