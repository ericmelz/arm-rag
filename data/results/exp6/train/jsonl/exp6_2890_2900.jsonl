He then went to another store where he spent one-third of his starting money, and then spent $16 more. If he then had no money left, how much did he have when he entered the first store?\n\nLet X be the initial amount Mark had.\nMark spent X/2 + 14 at the first store.\nHe had X - (X/2 + 14) = X/2 - 14 left.\nMark spent X/3 + 16 at the second store.\nThus, he had X/2 - 14 - (X/3 + 16) = 0 left.\nThus, X/2 - X/3 = 14 + 16.\nThus, (3X - 2X)/(2 * 3) = 30.\nThus, X/6 = 30.\nThus, X = 180.

If he then had no money left, how much did he have when he entered the first store?\n\nLet X be the amount Mark had when entering the first store.\nHe spent 1/2*X + 14 in the first store.\nHe had X - (1/2*X + 14) = 1/2*X - 14 left.\nHe spent 1/3*X + 16 in the second store.\nHe had 1/2*X - 14 - (1/3*X + 16) = -1/6*X - 30 left.\nSince he had nothing left, -1/6*X - 30 = 0.\nThus, -1/6*X = 30.\nHence, X = -30 / -1/6 = <<30*(-1)/(1/6)=180>>180 dollars.

If his friend agrees to kick in $10, how much should Mark add?\n\nThe tip Mark wants to give is 20% of $200, which is $200 * 0.20 = $<<200*0.20=40>>40.\nIf Mark's friend contributes $10, Mark should add $40 - $10 = $<<40-10=30>>30.

How much did he collect?\n\nHe got money from 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 households per day\nSo he got money from 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 households\nHe got money from 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 20s\nSo that means he collected 100*20=$<<100*20=2000>>2000.
