Wolverine, their friend, works out for twice the combined total number of hours both Rayman and Junior take during their workouts. Calculate the number of hours Wolverine takes doing her workouts if Rayman does workouts for 10 hours in a week.\n\nIf Rayman does workouts for 10 hours in a week, and he works out for half the number of hours Junior works out in a week, Junior also works out for 10*2 = <<10*2=20>>20 hours.\nThe total number of hours that Rayman and Junior workout in a week is 20+10 = <<20+10=30>>30 hours.\nWolverine works out for twice the combined total number of hours Rayman and Junior take during their workouts, a total of 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 hours. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: Osborn is testing a new way to get dressed in the morning on school days so he goes faster and can get up later. He tracks his time for the week and on Monday is takes him 2 minutes. On Tuesday it takes him 4 minutes. On Wednesday it takes him 3 minutes. On Thursday it takes him 4 minutes. Before Friday arrives he looks at his old way of getting dressed and sees that it was taking him 3 minutes on average to get dressed. How fast does he have to get dressed on Friday so his weekly average ties his old method?\n\nTo calculate the average time Osborn needs to get dressed for the week to tie his old method, we need to find the sum of his times for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n\nMonday: 2 minutes\nTuesday: 4 minutes\nWednesday: 3 minutes\nThursday: 4 minutes\n\nThe sum of these times is 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13 minutes.\n\nTo tie his old method's average of 3 minutes, the total time for the week needs to be 3 * 5 = 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Osborn needs to get dressed in 15 - 13 = <<15-13=2>>2 minutes on Friday to tie his old method's average. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Janet goes to the gym for 5 hours a week.  She goes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.  She spends an hour and a half each day on Monday and Wednesday.  If she spends the same amount of time at the gym on Tuesday and Friday how many hours is she at the gym on Friday?\n\nJanet spends 1.5 hours on Monday and 1.5 hours on Wednesday for a total of 1.5+1.5 = <<1.5+1.5=3>>3 hours\nIf she goes to the gym for 5 hours a week and has already been to the gym for 3 hours then she has 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2 hours left\nSince she spends the same amount of time at the gym on Tuesday and Friday she is at the gym for 2/2 = 1 hour on Friday. Answer: \\boxed{1}.\n\n\nQuestion: James takes a spinning class 3 times a week.  He works out for 1.5 hours each class and burns 7 calories per minute.  How many calories does he burn per week?\n\nHe works out for 1.5*60=<<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes per class\nSo he works out for 90*3=<<90*3=270>>270 minutes per week\nThat means he burns 270*7=<<270*7=1890>>1890 calories. Answer: \\boxed{1890}.\n\n\nQuestion: In a week, Rayman works out for half the number of hours Junior takes to work out.
