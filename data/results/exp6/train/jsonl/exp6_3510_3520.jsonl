They both decide to work as babysitters and save half of what they've earned for their trip. If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?\n\nSally makes $6 per day and saves half of it, so she saves $6/2 = $<<6/2=3>>3 per day.\nBob makes $4 per day and saves half of it, so he saves $4/2 = $<<4/2=2>>2 per day.\nCombined, they save a total of $3 + $2 = $<<3+2=5>>5 per day.\nIn a year, with 365 days, they will save in total $5 * 365 = $<<5*365=1825>>1825.

How much money will that require per person?\n\nThe total cost of the box of ice cream bars is $7.50 and there are 3 bars, so each bar costs 7.50/3 = $<<7.50/3=2.50>>2.50\nIf each of the 6 friends wants to each eat 2 bars, and each bar cost $2.50, then it will require 6*2*$2.50 = $<<6*2*2.5=30.00>>30.00\nIf 6 friends all chip in $30.00 that will require 30/6 = $<<30/6=5.00>>5.00 per person. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: A box of ice cream bars costs $7.50 and contains three bars.  6 friends want to each eat 2 bars.  How much money will that require per person?\n", "text": "To find the total number of bars needed, multiply the number of friends by the number of bars each friend wants to eat: 6 friends * 2 bars = <<6*2=12>>12 bars. \nSince each box has 3 bars, divide the total number of bars by the number of bars per box to find the number of boxes needed: 12 bars / 3 bars per box = <<12/3=4>>4 boxes. \nTo find the total cost, multiply the cost per box by the number of boxes: $7.50 * 4 boxes = $<<7.5*4=30.00>>30.00. \nFinally, to find the cost per person, divide the total cost by the number of friends: $30.00 / 6 friends = $<<30/6=5.00>>5.00 per person. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}
