If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?\n\nLet X be the number of packages delivered by the third butcher.\nThus, the total number of packages delivered by the first butcher is 10 - X.\nAnd the total number of packages delivered by the second butcher is 7.\nAll these packages weigh 4 * (10 - X) + 4 * 7 + 4X = 100 pounds.\nThus, 40 - 4X + 28 + 4X = 100 pounds.\nThus, 68 = 100 pounds.\nThus, the third butcher delivered 100 - 68 = <<100-68=32>>32 pounds.\nTherefore, the third butcher delivered 32 / 4 = <<32/4=8>>8 packages.
