A small puzzle and a large puzzle together cost $23. How much would you pay for 1 large and 3 small puzzles?\n\nLet's assume that the small puzzle costs S dollars.\nAccording to the problem, one large and one small puzzle cost 23 dollars. So we have the equation S + 15 = 23.\nSo, S = 23 - 15 = 8 dollars.\nNow, let's calculate the cost of one large and three small puzzles.\nThe cost of one large puzzle is 15 dollars, and the cost of three small puzzles is 3S = 3 * 8 = 24 dollars.\nTherefore, the total cost is 15 + 24 = <<15+24=39>>39 dollars.

What is the difference in area between the two shapes?\n\nThe area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 3 inches \u00d7 6 inches = <<3*6=18>>18 square inches.\nThe area of a square is found by squaring its side length. Therefore, the area of the square is 5 inches \u00d7 5 inches = <<5*5=25>>25 square inches.\nThe difference in area between the two shapes is 25 square inches - 18 square inches = <<25-18=7>>7 square inches.
