Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, but each puppy eats three times as often as a dog. If a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, what would be the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day?\n\nThe total weight of food eaten by each dog in a day is 4 pounds * 3 times = <<4*3=12>>12 pounds\nSince each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, a puppy eats 12 pounds / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pounds of food in a day.\nSince each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, the total weight of food eaten by a puppy in a day is 6 pounds * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 pounds.\nThe total amount of food the puppies eat in a day is 4 puppies * 18 pounds/puppy = <<4*18=72>>72 pounds\nThe total amount of food the dogs eat in a day is 3 dogs * 12 pounds/dog = <<3*12=36>>36 pounds.\nTherefore, the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat is 72 pounds + 36 pounds = <<72+36=108>>108 pounds.

Since each puppy eats three times as often as a dog, the total weight of food eaten by a puppy in a day is 6 pounds * 3 = 18 pounds. The total amount of food the puppies eat in a day is 4 puppies * 18 pounds/puppy = 72 pounds The total amount of food the dogs eat in a day is 3 dogs * 12 pounds/dog = 36 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat is 72 pounds + 36 pounds = 108 pounds. Answer: \\boxed{108}."}

How much money does Kurt save in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator?\n", "text": "Kurt's old refrigerator cost $0.85 a day in electricity and his new refrigerator costs $0.45 a day. Thus, he saves $0.85 - $0.45 = $0.40 per day with his new refrigerator. In a 30-day month, he saves $0.40 * 30 = $12.00. Therefore, Kurt saves $12.00 in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator.
