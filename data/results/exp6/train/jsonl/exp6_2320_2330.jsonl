But Pete can walk on his hands only one quarter the speed that Tracy can do cartwheels.  If Pete walks on his hands at 2 miles per hour, how fast can Pete walk backwards, in miles per hour?\n\nIf Pete walks on hands at 1/4 the speed Tracy does one-handed cartwheels, then since his walking-on-hands speed is 2 miles per hour, Tracy does one-handed cartwheels at 2*4=8 miles per hour.\nIf Tracy does one-handed cartwheels twice as fast as Susan walks forwards, then Susan walks forwards at a speed of 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 miles per hour.\nTherefore, since Pete walks backwards three times faster than Susan walks forwards, Pete walks backwards at a speed of 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 miles per hour.

If they want to make $60000 in an entire year how many more dollars per month should they make selling shoes?\n\nTo make $60,000 in an entire year, the shoe company needs to make $60,000/12 = $<<60000/12=5000>>5000 per month.\nTherefore, they need to make an additional $5000 - $4000 = $<<5000-4000=1000>>1000 per month.

If she paid $480, how much was the original price of the pair of shoes?\n\nLet X be the original price.\nThe discount her original price is X - X*.2 = .8*X\nSo she paid X - X*.2 = $480.\nThus X - X*.2 = $480.\nThus X*.8 = $480.\nSo X = $480 / .8 = $<<480/.8=600>>600. Answer: \\boxed{600}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark bought a shirt, pants, and shoes for $340. What is the price of the pants knowing that the price of a shirt is three-quarters of the price of the pants and that the price of a shoe is ten dollars more than the price of the pants?\n\nLet X be the price of the pants.\nSo the price of the shirt is (3/4)X.\nAnd the price of the shoes is X+10.\nSo the total cost of the shirt, pants, and shoes is X + (3/4)X + X+10 = $340.\nCombining like terms, we get 2.75*X = 330.\nDividing both sides by 2.75 gives us X = $120. Answer: \\boxed{120}.\n\n\nQuestion: I bought a pair of shoes for $51. The shoes were already marked 75% off.
