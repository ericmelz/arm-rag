How much is their security deposit?\n\nThe cabin costs $125.00 a day and they are staying 2 weeks so that\u2019s 125*14 = $<<125*14=1750.00>>1,750.00\nThere is a $100.00 pet fee and the cabin cost $1,750.00 so that\u2019s a total of 100+1,750 = $<<100+1750=1850.00>>1,850.00\nThere is a 20% service fee/cleaning fee on the $1,850.00 rental fee so that\u2019s .20*1850 = $<<20*.01*1850=370.00>>370.00\nThe rental fee is $1,850.00 and they are charged a $370.00 cleaning fee so that\u2019s 1850+370 = $<<1850+370=2220.00>>2,220.00\nYou need to pay 50% of the entire bill for a security deposit so that\u2019s .50*2,220 = $<<.50*2220=1110.00>>1,110.00. Answer: \\boxed{1110}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He\u2019s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?\n\nIf Eric rents the house for 20 days, he will need to pay for a combination of 14-day rental and a 6-day rental.\nThe cost of a 14-day rental is $500.00\nThe cost of a 6-day rental is 6*$50 = $<<6*50=300.00>>300.00\nThus, the total cost of renting for 20 days is $500 + $300 = $<<500+300=800.00>>800.00. Answer: \\boxed{800}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He\u2019s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?\n\nIf he rents for 14 or fewer days, the cost is $50.00 per day.  Since he wants it for 20 days, he has 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 days\nThat means he pays 6*50 = $<<6*50=300.00>>300.00\nSo in total, it will cost him 500+300 = $<<500+300=800.00>>800.00.
