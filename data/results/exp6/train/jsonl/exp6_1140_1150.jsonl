If half a cup is 8 tablespoons and one tablespoon is 3 teaspoons, how many grains of rice are in a teaspoon?\n", "text": "First, we need to determine the number of tablespoons in one cup if half a cup is 8 tablespoons.\nSince half a cup is 8 tablespoons, then one cup is 8 x 2 = 16 tablespoons.\nSince one tablespoon is 3 teaspoons, then 16 tablespoons are 16 x 3 = 48 teaspoons.\nTherefore, there are 480 grains / 48 teaspoons = 10 grains of rice in a teaspoon. Answer: \\boxed{10}."}
