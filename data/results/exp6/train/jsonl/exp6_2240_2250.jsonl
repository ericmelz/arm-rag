If Billy counts 70 ring groups in the first tree and 40 ring groups in the second tree, how much older is the first tree? (Trees grow 1 ring per year.)\n\nThe first tree has 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 rings.\nSo, it's 420 - 1 = <<420-1=419>>419 years old.\n\nThe second tree has 40 * 6 = <<40*6=240>>240 rings.\nSo, it's 240 - 1 = <<240-1=239>>239 years old.\n\nTherefore, the first tree is 419 - 239 = <<419-239=180>>180 years older than the second one.

If Billy counts 70 ring groups in the first tree and 40 ring groups in the second tree, how much older is the first tree? (Trees grow 1 ring per year.)\n\nThe first tree has a total of 70 x 2 = <<70*2=140>>140 fat rings.\nAnd it has 70 x 4 = <<70*4=280>>280 thin rings.\nSo, the first tree has a total of 140 + 280 = <<140+280=420>>420 rings.\nThe second tree has a total of 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 fat rings.\nAnd it has 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160 thin rings.\nTherefore, the second tree has a total of 80 + 160 = <<80+160=240>>240 rings.\nThus, the first tree is 420 - 240 = <<420-240=180>>180 rings older than the second tree.
