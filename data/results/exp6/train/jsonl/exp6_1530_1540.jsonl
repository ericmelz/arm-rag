How many kilograms does Antoinette weigh?\n\nLet's say Rupert's weight is R kilograms.\nIf Antoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than twice Rupert's weight, she weighs 2*R - 7 kilograms.\nThe total weight of the two is R + 2*R - 7 = 98 kilograms.\nCombining like terms, we get 3*R - 7 = 98.\nAdding 7 to both sides, we get 3*R = 105.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get R = 35 kilograms.\nSince Antoinette weighs 2*R - 7 = 2*35 - 7 = 70 - 7 = <<2*35-7=63>>63 kilograms.

How many kilograms does Antoinette weigh?\n\nLet's assume Rupert's weight is x kilograms.\nTwice Rupert's weight is 2*x = 2x.\nAntoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than twice Rupert's weight, which is 2x -7.\nThe total weight of both Antoinette and Rupert is 98 kilograms, which is equal to x + (2x - 7).\nCombining like terms, the equation becomes 3x - 7 = 98.\nAdding 7 to both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 105.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 35.\nTherefore, Antoinette weighs 2x - 7 = 2(35) - 7 = 63 kilograms.

How many kilograms does Antoinette weigh?\n", "text": "Let's assume that Rupert's weight is represented by the variable \"x\" (in kilograms).\nAccording to the information given, Antoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than twice Rupert's weight. Therefore, Antoinette's weight can be represented as 2x - 7.\nAdditionally, we know that the total weight of both Antoinette and Rupert is 98 kilograms.\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can set up the equation (x) + (2x - 7) = 98.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 3x - 7 = 98.\nAdding 7 to both sides of the equation, we have 3x = 105.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, we find that x = 35.\nNow, we can determine Antoinette's weight by substituting the value of x back into the expression 2x - 7.\nThus, Antoinette weighs 2(35) - 7 = 70 - 7 = 63 kilograms.\nTherefore, Antoinette weighs 63 kilograms.
