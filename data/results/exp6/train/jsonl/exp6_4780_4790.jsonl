Then her dad raises her allowance, and she receives $6 a week for 6 weeks. Francie uses half of the money to buy new clothes. With the remaining money, she buys a video game that costs $35. How much money does Francie have remaining after buying the video game?\n\nFrancie receives 8 weeks * $5/week = $<<8*5=40>>40 before her dad raises her allowance.\nAfter her dad raises her allowance, Francie receives 6 weeks * $6/week = $<<6*6=36>>36.\nIn total Francie receives $40 + $36 = $<<40+36=76>>76.\nFrancie uses half, $76/2 = $<<76/2=38>>38 to buy new clothes.\nShe therefore has $76 - $38 = $<<76-38=38>>38 remaining.\nAfter buying the video game Francie has $38 - $35 = $<<38-35=3>>3 remaining.

The wholesale club sells ground beef in 5-pound packages. Maurice wants to make one 2-pound burger for each person that attends, so he purchases 4 packages of ground beef. How many people can Maurice invite to the cookout so that everybody, including himself, gets a burger?\n\nMaurice purchases 4 packages of ground beef, which totals 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds.\nSince he wants to make a 2-pound burger per person, he can make 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 burgers in total.\nTherefore, Maurice can invite 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 people to the cookout.
