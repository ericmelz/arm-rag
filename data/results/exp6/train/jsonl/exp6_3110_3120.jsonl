During the trip, the plane hovered in Mountain time for 3 hours, Central time for 4 hrs, and Eastern time for 2 hrs. The next day it took 2 more hours to hover in each of the places it passed through the previous day. Calculate the total time it took the plane to hover over Mountain time, Central time, and Eastern time in the two days.\n\nIn the first day, the total time the plane spent hovering is:\nMountain time: 3 hours\nCentral time: 4 hours\nEastern time: 2 hours\nTherefore, the total time on the first day is 3+4+2 = <<3+4+2=9>>9 hours\nThe next day, the time spent in each location is increased by 2 hours\nMountain time: 3+2 = 5 hours\nCentral time: 4+2 = 6 hours\nEastern time: 2+2 = 4 hours\nSo the total time on the next day is 5+6+4 = <<5+6+4=15>>15 hours\nTherefore, in the two days, the total time is 9+15 = <<9+15=24>>24 hours.
