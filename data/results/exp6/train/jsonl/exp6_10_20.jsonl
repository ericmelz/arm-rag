Answer: \\boxed{121}.\n\n\nQuestion: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's assume that the first ship had x number of people on it.\nAccording to the problem, the second ship had twice as many people as the first ship, so it had 2x people on it.\nSimilarly, the third ship had twice as many people as the second ship, so it had 4x people on it.\nIn general, we can say that the nth ship had 2^(n-1)x people on it.\nOver three hundred years, the sum of people eaten by the monster is 847 people.\nSo, we can write it as: x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^(n-1)x = 847\nThis is a geometric series, and we can calculate its sum using the formula:\nSum = (first term * (1 - r^n)) / (1 - r), where r is the common ratio.\nIn this case, the common ratio is 2 (as each ship has twice as many people as the previous one), and we want to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\nSo, the equation becomes: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (1 - 2) = 847\nSimplifying further, we get: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (-1) = 847\nOr, x * (2^n - 1) = 847\nLet's solve this equation for n = 3 (as we know the sum of people eaten is 847).\nx * (2^3 - 1) = 847\nx * 7 = 847\nx = 847 / 7\nx = 121\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years. Answer: \\boxed{121}.\n\n\nQuestion: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's first find out how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the last hundred years. We know that over the three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people, and each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Let's assume there were X people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nSince each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the second hundred years is 2*X.\nAnd the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the third hundred years is 2*2*X = 4*X.\n\nTherefore, over the three hundred years, the total number of people consumed by the monster is X + 2*X + 4*X = 7*X = 847.\nTo find X, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: X = 847/7 = <<847/7=121>>121.\n\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.

Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nTo find the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we need to find the total number of people eaten by the monster in the first three hundred years. We know that over the three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people.\n\nLet's assume that the number of people on the first ship is 'x'.\nIn the second hundred years, there would be 2x people on the ship.\nIn the third hundred years, there would be 2 * 2x = 4x people on the ship.\n\nSo, the total number of people eaten by the monster over the three hundred years is: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.\n\nWe also know that the total number of people eaten by the monster over three hundred years is 847.\n\nTherefore, 7x = 847.\nDividing both sides by 7: x = 121.\n\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.

He took the rest to his home planet.  How many people did he take to his home planet?\n\nThe alien returns 80% of the 200 people abducted, so he returns 80/100 * 200 = <<80/100*200=160>>160 people.\nHe took 10 people to another planet, so he has already returned 160 + 10 = <<160+10=170>>170 people.\nThe rest of the people, meaning the number of people he took to his home planet, is 200 - 170 = <<200-170=30>>30 people.

How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?\n\nTo get to work, Roque spends a total of 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours walking.\nTo get back home, Roque spends another 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours walking.\nSo, Roque spends a total of 6 + 6 = <<6+6=12>>12 hours walking to and from work a week.\nTo get to work, Roque also spends a total of 1 x 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours riding his bike.\nTo get back home, he spends another 1 x 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours.\nTherefore, Roque spends a total of 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours biking to and from work a week.\nTherefore, Roque takes a total of 12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 hours to get to and from work a week.

The bus takes ten minutes longer since it stops at every bus stop for other passengers. His friend driving him is the fastest and cuts two-thirds off his biking time. How many minutes does he spend every week commuting to work?\n\nRyan spends 30*2/3 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes less biking when he gets a ride from his friend.\nHis driving time is 30-20= <<30-20=10>>10 minutes.\nHis friend driving him takes the least amount of time, so he spends that time every week, or 10 minutes * 1 time = <<10*1=10>>10 minutes\nThe bus takes 10 minutes longer than biking, so it takes 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40 minutes per ride.\nRyan takes the bus 3 times per week, for a total of 3 times * 40 minutes = <<3*40=120>>120 minutes spent on the bus per week\nLastly, Ryan bikes to work one day a week, so he spends 1 day * 30 minutes = <<1*30=30>>30 minutes biking.\nIn total, Ryan spends 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = <<30+120+10=160>>160 minutes every week commuting to work.

During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.

If his daily goal is 10,000 steps, how many minutes will it take him to reach his goal?\n\nHe walks 2000 steps in 30 minutes and his goal is 10,000 steps. This means he walks 10000/2000 = <<10000/2000=5>>5 times his goal\nIt takes him 30 minutes to reach 2000 steps and he does this 5 times so it will take him 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes.
