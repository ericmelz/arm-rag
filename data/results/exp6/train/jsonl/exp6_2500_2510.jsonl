That game promises 100 hours of gameplay but 80% of that is boring grinding.  However, the expansion does add another 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay.  How much enjoyable gameplay does James get?\n\nThe base game promises 100 hours of gameplay, but 80% of that is boring grinding, which means only 100 - (100 * 80%) = 100 - 80 = <<100-(100*80*.01)=20>>20 hours are enjoyable.\nThe expansion adds another 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay.\nTherefore, James gets a total of 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 hours of enjoyable gameplay.

How long does it take before he can play the main game?\n\nJames spends 10 minutes downloading the game.\nThe installation takes half as long, which is 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes.\nGoing through the tutorial takes triple the combined amount of time, which is 3 * (10 + 5) = <<3*(10+5)=45>>45 minutes.\nTherefore, it takes a total of 10 + 5 + 45 = <<10+5+45=60>>60 minutes before James can play the main game. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: James spends 10 minutes downloading a game, half as long installing it, and triple that combined amount of time going through the tutorial. How long does it take before he can play the main game?\n\nFirst, we need to determine how long James spends installing the game. We know that he spends half as long installing it as he did downloading it, so that means he spends 10 minutes / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes installing the game.\nNext, we need to determine how long James spends going through the tutorial. We know that he spends triple the combined amount of time downloading and installing the game, so that means he spends 3 * (10 minutes + 5 minutes) = <<3*(10+5)=45>>45 minutes going through the tutorial.\nFinally, to determine how long James has to wait before he can play the main game, we add up the time spent downloading, installing, and going through the tutorial: 10 minutes + 5 minutes + 45 minutes = <<10+5+45=60>>60 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: James spends 10 minutes downloading a game, half as long installing it, and triple that combined amount of time going through the tutorial. How long does it take before he can play the main game?\n\nFirst, we need to find the total time James spends in the tutorial.\nThe time spent downloading the game is 10 minutes.\nThe time spent installing the game is half that, so it's 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes.\nThe combined time spent downloading and installing is 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 minutes.\nTriple that amount of time is 15 * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 minutes.\nTherefore, James must spend 45 minutes going through the tutorial.\nThus, it takes James 10 + 5 + 45 = <<10+5+45=60>>60 minutes before he can play the main game.

The second artifact takes 3 times as long for the research and discovery.  How long did it take him to find both?\n\nThe research took 6/12=<<6/12=.5>>.5 years\nSo the first artifact took 2+.5=<<2.5=2.5>>2.5 years\nThat means the second artifact took 2.5*3=<<2.5*3=7.5>>7.5 years\nSo in total, it took 2.5+7.5=<<2.5+7.5=10>>10 years. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: James gets bored with his game so decides to play a different one.  That game promises 100 hours of gameplay but 80% of that is boring grinding.

Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Yvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes.  Her younger sister can swim half as many laps as Yvonne in the same time frame.  Their brother Joel can swim three times the number of laps as the youngest sister.  How many laps can Joel swim?\n\nYvonne swims 10 laps in 5 minutes and her sister can swim half that amount so she swims 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 laps in 5 minutes\nIf the sister can swim 5 laps in 5 minutes and Joel can swim three times as many laps then Joel can swim 5*3 = <<5*3=15>>15 laps.

It takes Sadie 2 hours to run through the forest at an average speed of 3 miles per hour. Ariana sprints across the open field on her section at 6 miles per hour for half an hour. If Sarah runs along the beach at four miles per hour and their total time for the race is four and half hours, what is the total distance of the race?\n", "text": "Sadie runs 3 miles/hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.\nAriana runs 6 miles/hour * 0.5 hour = 3 miles.\nSarah runs for 4.5 - 2 - 0.5 = 2 hours on the beach.\nSarah runs 4 miles/hour * 2 = 8 miles.\nThe total distance of the race is 6 miles + 3 miles + 8 miles = 17 miles. Answer: \\boxed{17}."}
