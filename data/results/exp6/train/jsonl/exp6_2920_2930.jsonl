Answer: \\boxed{40}.\n\n\nQuestion: The total average age of three friends is 40. Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, and Molly's age is 30. How old is Hakimi?\n\nLet's say Hakimi's age is x.\nJared's age is x+10.\nTogether, Jared and Hakimi's ages amount to x+x+10 = 2x+10.\nThe total age of the three friends is 2x+10+30 = 2x+40.\nBut the total average age of the three friends is 40.\nThis means that 2x+40 = 3*40 = 120.\nTherefore, 2x= 120-40= <<120-40=80>>80.\nHakimi's age is x=80/2 = <<80/2=40>>40 years old. Answer: \\boxed{40}.\n\n\nQuestion: The total average age of three friends is 40. Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, and Molly's age is 30. How old is Hakimi?\n\nLet's assume Hakimi's age is x.\nSince Molly's age is 30, and the total average age is 40, the total age of the three friends is 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120\nIf Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, then Jared's age is x+10.\nThe sum of the ages of the three friends is Jared's age + Molly's age + Hakimi's age = 120 = (x+10) + 30 + x\nCombining like terms we get 2x+40 =120\nSubtracting 40 from both sides we get 2x=80\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x=<<40=40>>40. Answer: \\boxed{40}.\n\n\nQuestion: The total average age of three friends is 40. Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, and Molly's age is 30. How old is Hakimi?\n\nLet's assume Hakimi's age to be x.\nIf the average age of the three friends is 40, then the total age of the three friends must be 40*3 = <<40*3=120>>120.\nSince Molly's age is 30, Jared and Hakimi's combined age would be 120-30 = 90.\nLet's assume Jared's age to be y.\nSince Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, we can represent this as y = x+10.\nTherefore, y + x = 90.\nSince Molly's age is 30, we can represent this as x + y + 30 = 120.\nSubstituting the value of y from the first equation into the second equation, we get x + (x+10) + 30 = 120.\nThis simplifies to 2x + 40 = 120.\nSubtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 80.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 40.\nHakimi's age is therefore 40 years old.

What percentage of Boyd\u2019s friends are boys?\n\nJulian has 80 x 40/100 = <<80*40/100=32>>32 friends who are girls.\nSo, 80 - 32 = <<80-32=48>>48 friends who are boys.\nSince Boyd has twice as many friends who are girls, then he has 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 friends who are girls.\nSo, Boyd has 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 friends who are boys.\nTherefore, 36/100 x 100 = <<36/100*100=36>>36% of Boyd\u2019s friends are boys.

If they want to make $60000 in an entire year how many more dollars per month should they make selling shoes?\n\nTo make $60,000 in an entire year, the shoe company needs to make $60,000/12 = $<<60000/12=5000>>5000 per month.\nTherefore, they need to make an additional $5000 - $4000 = $<<5000-4000=1000>>1000 per month. Answer: \\boxed{1000}.\n\n\nQuestion: A shoe company sells $4000 worth of shoes every month. If they want to make $60000 in an entire year how many more dollars per month should they make selling shoes?\n\nTo find out how much more the shoe company needs to make per month, we need to subtract the current monthly sales from the desired annual sales. \n\nThe company wants to make $60,000 in a year, so the monthly goal is $60,000 /12 months = $<<60000/12=5000>>5000 per month.\n\nThey currently sell $4000 worth of shoes per month.\n\nTherefore, the shoe company needs to make an additional $5000 - $4000 = $<<5000-4000=1000>>1000 more per month.

They had profits of $1,500 in the first quarter of the year, $3,000 in the third quarter, and $2,000 in the fourth quarter. If their annual profits are $8,000, how much profit, in dollars, did they make in the second quarter?\n\nIn the first three quarters of the year, they made $1500 + $3000 + $2000 = $<<1500+3000+2000=6500>>6500.\nThis means that in the second quarter, they made $8000 - $6500 = $<<8000-6500=1500>>1500.
