Alma has a bag of baby carrots she brought to have for a snack and decides to feed the goats with them. Alma wants to make sure all the goats get the same amount of carrots, so she starts counting them out. She has 47 baby carrots. If she wants to give the exact same amount of carrots to each goat and wants to feed them all the carrots she can, how many will she have left over?\n", "text": "If Alma wants to give the exact same amount of carrots to each goat, she needs to divide the total number of carrots by the number of goats. Since there are 4 goats, she should divide 47 by 4.\n47/4 = 11.75\nSince Alma can't give the goats a fraction of a carrot, she can only give each goat 11 carrots. This means that she will have 47 - (11 * 4) = 47 - 44 = 3 carrots left over. Answer: \\boxed{3}."}

The second sells the same computer for \u20ac920 with a 5% discount. What is the difference in price between the two stores?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discount for each device.\n\nIn the first store, the computer has a 6% discount, which means the discount is 950 * 0.06 = $<<950*0.06=57>>57.\n\nSo the final price in the first store is 950 - 57 = $<<950-57=893>>893.\n\nIn the second store, the computer has a 5% discount, which means the discount is 920 * 0.05 = \u20ac<<920*0.05=46>>46.\n\nSo the final price in the second store is 920 - 46 = \u20ac<<920-46=874>>874.\n\nThe difference in price between the two stores is 893 - 874 = $<<893-874=19>>19.
