Each box of fireworks contains 8 fireworks. If it takes 6 fireworks to display a number and 5 fireworks to display a letter, how many fireworks are lit during the display?\n\nThe full year is shown with 4 numbers, so this uses 4 numbers * 6 fireworks per number = <<4*6=24>>24 fireworks.\n\u201cHAPPY NEW YEAR\u201d contains 12 letters, so the letters use 5 fireworks per letter * 12 letters = <<5*12=60>>60 fireworks.\nThe total number of fireworks lit before the final 50 boxes is 24 fireworks + 60 fireworks = <<24+60=84>>84 fireworks.\nThe last 50 boxes * 8 fireworks per box = <<50*8=400>>400 fireworks.\nSo the total number of fireworks lit is 84 fireworks + 400 fireworks = <<84+400=484>>484 fireworks.

Each box of fireworks contains 8 fireworks. If it takes 6 fireworks to display a number and 5 fireworks to display a letter, how many fireworks are lit during the display?\n\nTo display the full year, they need to display 4 numbers, which takes 4 numbers per number x 6 fireworks = <<4*6=24>>24 fireworks.\nTo display \u201cHAPPY NEW YEAR\u201d they need to display 12 letters, which takes 5 fireworks per letter x 12 letters = <<5*12=60>>60 fireworks.\nSo in total for the display so far, they\u2019ve lit 24 + 60 = <<24+60=84>>84 fireworks.\nAs each box of fireworks contains 8 fireworks, then 50 boxes means 50 boxes x 8 fireworks = <<50*8=400>>400 fireworks.\nTherefore the total number of fireworks lit during the display is 400 + 84 = <<400+84=484>>484 fireworks.

If his daily goal is 10,000 steps, how many minutes will it take him to reach his goal?\n\nHe walks 2000 steps in 30 minutes and his goal is 10,000 steps. This means he walks 10000/2000 = <<10000/2000=5>>5 times his goal\nIt takes him 30 minutes to reach 2000 steps and he does this 5 times so it will take him 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes.

How many hours does Steve spend with his family in a day?\n\nThe fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12).\n\nTo simplify the last fraction, we need to find the least common multiple of 3, 6, and 12.\n\n3 = 3 \u00d7 1,\n6 = 3 \u00d7 2,\n12 = 3 \u00d7 4.\n\nThe least common multiple is 3 \u00d7 4 = <<3*4=12>>12.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12) = (12/12 - 4/12 - 2/12 - 1/12) = 5/12.\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, Steve spends (5/12) \u00d7 24 = <<(5/12)*24=10>>10 hours with his family.
