How much does he pay in a 30-day month?\n\nEach pill cost $1.5 and he needs to take 2 a day so that's 1.5*2 = $3.00 a day\nHe takes 2 pills a day and over a 30 day month that's 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 pills\nThe pills are $3.00 per day and over 30 days it will cost 3*30 = $<<3*30=90.00>>90.00\nInsurance covers 40% of the cost so they pay 90*.40 = $<<90*.40=36.00>>36.00 of the 90.00\nSo he has to pay 90-36 = $<<90-36=54.00>>54.00. Answer: \\boxed{54}.\n\n\nQuestion: John gets a new EpiPen every 6 months.  They cost $500 and insurance covers 75%.  How much does he pay per year?\n\nHe gets 12/6=<<12/6=2>>2 pens a year\nEach pen costs $500*.25=$<<500*.25=125>>125\nSo each year he pays 2*$125=$<<2*125=250>>250. Answer: \\boxed{250}.\n\n\nQuestion: John needs to take 2 pills a day.  One pill costs $1.5.  The insurance covers 40% of the cost.  How much does he pay in a 30-day month?\n", "text": "The total cost of taking 2 pills a day is $1.5 * 2 = $3. \nThe insurance covers 40% of the cost, so John only needs to pay 60% of the cost.\nTherefore, he pays $3 * 0.6 = $1.8 per day.\nIn a 30-day month, he pays $1.8 * 30 = $54.
