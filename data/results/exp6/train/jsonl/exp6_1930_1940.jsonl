Shawn now has to dump half of the water away. How much water is left?\n\nThe amount of water per minute for the first 30 minutes is 2/10=<<2/10=.2>>.2 cups\nSo the total amount of water is .2*30=<<.2*30=6>>6 cups\nThe amount of water per minute for the next 30 minutes is also .2, so he has another 6 cups in this period.\nSo for the first hour, there's a total of 6+6= <<6+6=12>>12 cups.\nFor the next hour, he has 4 cups per minute so he has 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 cups.\nSo after 2 hours, Shawn has a total of 24+12=<<24+12=36>>36 cups.\nAnd now Shawn has to dump 36/2=<<36/2=18>>18 cups of water.

How long will it take the pot to be full?\n\nFirst find the number of ml that drip into the pot each minute: 3 drops/minute * 20 ml/drop = 60 ml/minute\nThen find the number of ml the pot can hold by multiplying the number of liters it holds by 1000 ml/liter: 3 liters * 1000 ml/liter = <<3*1000=3000>>3000 ml\nThen divide the ml that go into the pot each minute by the number of ml it can hold: 3000 ml / 60 ml/minute = <<3000/60=50>>50 minutes.

Answer: \\boxed{315}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jeff orders a Halloween costume.  He has to put in a 10% deposit and then pay the rest when he picks it up.  The costume is 40% more expensive than last year's costume, which cost $250.  How much did he pay when picking it up, in dollars?\n\nThis year's costume cost 250*.4=$<<250*.4=100>>100 more than last year's costume.\nSo this year's costume cost 250+100=$<<250+100=350>>350.\nJeff put down a 350*.10=$<<350*.10=35>>35 deposit.\nTherefore, Jeff paid 350-35=$<<350-35=315>>315 when picking up the costume.

He found a nice apartment next to his school, the owner asks Jeff to pay $300 each month, Jeff agreed, and for the first 3 years everything went fine, but then the owner wanted to raise the price for each month to $350. Jeff agreed again and continued paying until he graduated. How much did Jeff end up paying for the apartment throughout the 5 years?\n", "text": "Jeff paid $300 per month for the first 3 years, so he paid a total of $300/month * 12 months/year * 3 years = $10800.\nAfter that, he paid $350 per month for the remaining 2 years, so he paid $350/month * 12 months/year * 2 years = $8400.\nIn total, Jeff paid $10800 + $8400 = $19200 for the apartment throughout the 5 years. Answer: \\boxed{19200}."}
