If the first warehouse has 400 boxes, how many boxes are there in both warehouses combined?\n\nIf the first warehouse has 400 boxes, and the second has half as many boxes as the first, then the second warehouse has 400/2= <<400/2=200>>200 boxes.\nAll together, the two warehouses hold 400+200=<<400+200=600>>600 boxes. Answer: \\boxed{600}.\n\n\nQuestion: A store received 20 pallets of paper products to stock. Half the pallets were paper towels, a quarter were tissues, and a fifth were paper plates. The rest were paper cups. How many pallets of paper cups did the store receive?\n\nHalf the pallets were paper towels, so the store received 20 is 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 pallets of paper towels.\nA quarter of the pallets were tissues, so the store received 20 is 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pallets of tissues.\nA fifth of the pallets were paper plates, so the store received 20 is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 pallets of paper plates.\nThe store received 20 - 10 - 5 - 4 = <<20-10-5-4=1>>1 pallet of paper cups. Answer: \\boxed{1}.\n\n\nQuestion: In a shipping container, there are 10 crates. Each crate is filled with 6 boxes and each box is filled with 4 washing machines. A worker removes 1 washing machine from each box. There are no other changes. How many washing machines were removed from the shipping container?\n", "text": "In each crate, there are 6 boxes * 4 washing machines = 24 washing machines.\nSince there are 10 crates, in total there are 24 washing machines * 10 crates = 240 washing machines.\nIf the worker removes 1 washing machine from each box, then the worker removes 1 washing machines * 6 boxes * 10 crates = 60 washing machines. Answer: \\boxed{60}."}

The third one is 5 feet by 5 feet. If he wants his flag to be 15 feet long, how tall will it be?\n\nFirst find the total area of the first square: 8 feet * 5 feet = <<8*5=40>>40 square feet\nThen find the total area of the second square: 10 feet * 7 feet = <<10*7=70>>70 square feet\nThen find the total area of the third square: 5 feet * 5 feet = <<5*5=25>>25 square feet\nThen add the area of each fabric square to find the total area: 40 square feet + 70 square feet + 25 square feet = <<40+70+25=135>>135 square feet\nFinally, divide the total area by the length to find the height: 135 square feet / 15 feet = <<135/15=9>>9 feet.
