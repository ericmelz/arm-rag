If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\n\nIt takes 20 minutes to drive to school and another 20 minutes to drive back, so Jessica spends 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes driving to and from school each day.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so Jessica spends 40 / 60 = 2/3 of an hour driving to and from school each day.\nTo meet the 50-hour requirement, it will take her 50 / (2/3) = <<50/(2/3)=75>>75 school days.

If she drives to and from school every day, how many school days will it take Jessica to meet the 50-hour driving requirement?\n\nJessica spends a total of 20 minutes * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 minutes driving to and from school each day.\nThis means she spends 40 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<40/60=0.67>>0.67 hours driving to and from school each day.\nIt will take Jessica 50 hours / 0.67 hours/day = <<50/0.67=74.63>>74.63 school days to meet the 50-hour driving requirement.\nSince Jessica cannot complete a fraction of a school day, it will take her 75 school days to meet the 50-hour driving requirement. Answer: \\boxed{75}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jessica has one hour to take an exam. She has answered 16 out of 80 questions. She has used 12 minutes of her time. If she keeps up this same pace, how many minutes will be left when she finishes the exam?\n\nJessica still has 80 - 16 = <<80-16=64>>64 questions left to answer.\nShe has 60 - 12 = <<60-12=48>>48 minutes left to finish the exam.\nSo, Jessica has 48/64 = <<48/64=0.75>>0.75 minutes or 45 seconds left for every question.\nThus, Jessica will need to spend another 64 x 0.75 = <<64*0.75=48>>48 minutes or 2880 seconds to finish the remaining questions.\nTherefore, she will have 48 - 2880/60 = <<48-2880/60=0>>0 minutes or 0 seconds left when she finishes the exam. Answer: \\boxed{0}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jessica has a basic cable television service for $15 per month. If she adds the movie channels, it will cost an additional $12 per month. The sports channels cost $3 less per month than the movie channels. If Jessica adds the movie channels and the sports channels, what will her total monthly payment be?\n\nThe sports channels cost $12 - $3 = $<<12-3=9>>9 per month.\nSo, Jessica's total monthly payment will be $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.\nTherefore, Jessica's total monthly payment will be $21 + $15 = $<<21+15=36>>36. Answer: \\boxed{36}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jessica\u2019s class is going to a farm for a field trip. The school will bring all 35 students in the class plus 4 adult chaperones. The farm entrance fee for students costs $5 and $6 for adults. How much will the school pay for the farm entrance in all?\n\nThe entrance fee for students is $5 x 35 = $<<5*35=175>>175.\nThe entrance fee for adults is $6 x 4 = $<<6*4=24>>24.\nTherefore, the school will pay $175 + $24 = $<<175+24=199>>199 for the farm entrance in all. Answer: \\boxed{199}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jessica just got her driving permit. She must complete 50 hours of driving with a parent to get her driver\u2019s license. It takes 20 minutes to drive to school.

She also added twice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms, 4 times as many pickles as cherry tomatoes, and 4 times as many bacon bits as pickles.  If one third of the bacon bits were red, than how many red bacon bits did Grandma put on her salad?\n\nTwice as many cherry tomatoes as mushrooms is 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 cherry tomatoes.\nFour times as many pickles as cherry tomatoes is 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 pickles.\nFour times as many bacon bits as pickles is 4*24=<<4*24=96>>96 bacon bits.\nIf 1/3 of the bacon bits were red, then there were 96*(1/3)=32 red bacon bits.
