If he travels at a speed of 4km/hr for the first four hours, at what speed does he need to travel for the remainder of the journey to be right on time?\n\nThe man has already traveled 4 km/hr * 4 hr = <<4*4=16>>16 km in the first four hours.\nTherefore, he needs to travel 24 km - 16 km = <<24-16=8>>8 km more.\nSince he has 8 hours to complete the entire journey, he needs to travel the remaining distance in the remaining time, which is 8 hours - 4 hours = <<8-4=4>>4 hours.\nTo find the speed needed to travel the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time:\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 8km / 4hr = <<8/4=2>>2 km/hr.\nTherefore, the man needs to travel at a speed of 2 km/hr for the remainder of the journey to be right on time. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?\n\nIf all three stoplights are red, the man's trip will be delayed by 3 minutes per stoplight, or a total of 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 minutes.\nTherefore, his trip will take 10+9=<<10+9=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, the man's trip will be 19-14=<<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer if he chooses the first route.

This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?\n\nIf all three stoplights are red, the man's trip will take an additional 3 minutes per stoplight that is red, for a total of 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 minutes.\nThus, if the man chooses the first route and all three stoplights are red, his trip will take an additional 9 minutes beyond the 10 minutes it would take if all three lights were green, for a total of 10 + 9 = <<10+9=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, if the man chooses the first route, his trip will be 19 - 14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than if he took the second route.

If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\n\nWe can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.\n\nIn the morning, Mr. Maxwell drives at an average speed of 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance he travels is 30 miles.\n\nIn the evening, he takes 1.5 hours to drive back home. Since the morning and evening traffic is similar, we can assume that the distance is the same, 30 miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance for the return journey is also 30 miles.\n\nThe total time for the return journey is 1.5 hours.\n\nThus, the average speed of the return journey is 30 miles / 1.5 hours = <<30/1.5=20>>20 mph.

They stop at a McDonald's and then continue the rest of the journey for 300 miles. What's the total number of hours they traveled?\n\nIn the first section, they travel for 100 miles in 1 hour, so they are traveling for 100/1 = <<100/1=100>>100 miles/hour\nIn the second section, they travel for 300 miles, so they should spend 300/100 = <<300/100=3>>3 hours\nThe total journey takes 3+1 = <<3+1=4>>4 hours. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: The distance between Robin's house and the city center is 500 meters. He leaves the house to go to the city center.

He puts them into 4 bags.  He puts the same number in each bag.  He then gives one bag away.  How many marbles does James have left?\n\nSince the same number of marbles is put into each bag, then James puts 28/4=<<28/4=7>>7 marbles into each bag.\nBut since James gives one bag away, this means that he has 28-7=<<28-7=21>>21 marbles left. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: James has 28 marbles.  He puts them into 4 bags.  He puts the same number in each bag.  He then gives one bag away.  How many marbles does James have left?\n", "text": "To find the number of marbles James has left, we first need to figure out how many marbles he puts into each bag. Since he starts with 28 marbles and puts them into 4 bags, that means he puts 28/4=7 marbles into each bag.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many marbles James gives away. Since he gives away one bag, which contains 7 marbles, he gives away a total of 7 marbles.\n\nTo find out how many marbles James has left, we subtract the number of marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he started with. So, 28-7=21.\n\nTherefore, James has 21 marbles left. Answer: \\boxed{21}."}
