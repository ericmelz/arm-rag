This means that Monica has 10 / 0.25 = 40 earrings.\n- Monica has twice as many earrings as Rachel. Therefore, Rachel has 40 / 2 = 20 earrings.\n- To find the total number of earrings for all the friends, we add up Bella's, Monica's, and Rachel's earrings: 20 + 40 + 10 = 70.\nTherefore, all of the friends have a total of 70 earrings.
