There are 5 people in Amanda's family, including herself. There are 9 rooms in the house. 5 of the rooms have 4 walls each. The other 4 rooms each have 5 walls each. To be fair, how many walls should each person in Amanda's family paint?\n\nThere are a total of 5 rooms with 4 walls each, so these rooms have 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 walls.\nThere are a total of 4 rooms with 5 walls each, so these rooms have 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 walls.\nIn total, there are 20 + 20 = <<20+20=40>>40 walls in the house.\nSince there are 5 people in Amanda's family, each person should paint 40 / 5 = <<40/5=8>>8 walls.

The small ones require 1 bulb, the medium ones require 2, and the large ones need 3 bulbs. How many bulbs should I buy if my wife says she saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights and ten more small lights than medium ones?\n", "text": "Let's say the number of medium ceiling lights is M. According to the information given, the number of small ceiling lights is M + 10, and the number of large ceiling lights is 2M.\n\nThe number of bulbs required for small lights is (M + 10) \u00d7 1 = M + 10.\nThe number of bulbs required for medium lights is M \u00d7 2 = 2M.\nThe number of bulbs required for large lights is 2M \u00d7 3 = 6M.\n\nIn total, the number of bulbs needed is (M + 10) + 2M + 6M = 9M + 10.\n\nSince the number of medium ceiling lights is given as 12, we can substitute M = 12 into the equation: 9(12) + 10 = 108 + 10 = 118.\n\nTherefore, you should buy 118 bulbs. Answer: \\boxed{118}."}
