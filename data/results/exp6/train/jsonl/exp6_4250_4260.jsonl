She kept 1/3 of the sweets and divided the rest between her 3 children. The eldest got 8 sweets while the youngest got half as many. If there are 27 pieces of sweets in the box, how many sweets did the second child gets?\n\nThe mother kept 1/3 of the sweets, which means there are 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the sweets left for her 3 children.\nThere are a total of 3 children, so each child will have 2/3/3 = 2/9 of the sweets each.\nThe youngest child received half as many as the eldest child, so he received 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 pieces of sweets.\nThus, the second child received 2/9 x 27 - 4 - 8 = 6 pieces of sweets.

If there are 27 pieces of sweets in the box, how many sweets did the second child gets?\n\nThe mother kept 1/3 x 27 = <<1/3*27=9>>9 sweets for herself.\nSo, there were 27 - 9 = <<27-9=18>>18 sweets that were divided to the 3 children.\nThe youngest got 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 sweets.\nHence, the second child got 18 - 8 - 4 = <<18-8-4=6>>6 sweets.

If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?\n\nLet x be the number of boxes he bought.\nAfter giving a box to his mother, Seth had x-1 boxes left.\nHe gave away half, so he had (x-1)/2 left.\nSince he has 4 boxes left, (x-1)/2 = 4.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2 gives x-1 = 8.\nAdding 1 to both sides of the equation gives x = 9.
