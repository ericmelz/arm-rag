This means that the remaining 100% - 40% = 60% of students are divided into two equal groups.\nSince the two groups are equal in size, each group consists of 60% / 2 = 30% of the total student population.\nTherefore, the percent of students present in school is 30%.

The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?\n\nFirst express the number of omelets each group will eat: 53 small children * 1/2 omelet/child = <<53*1/2=26.5>>26.5 omelets\nThen do the same for the other groups: 35 older children * 1 omelet/child = <<35*1=35>>35 omelets\n75 adults * 2 omelets/adult = <<75*2=150>>150 omelets\n37 seniors * 1.5 omelets/senior = <<37*1.5=55.5>>55.5 omelets\nNow add up the number of omelets to find the total number: 26.5 omelets + 35 omelets + 150 omelets + 55.5 omelets + 25 omelets = <<26.5+35+150+55.5+25=292>>292 omelets\nNow multiply the number of omelets by the number of eggs per omelet: 292 omelets * 2 eggs/omelet = <<292*2=584>>584 eggs. Answer: \\boxed{584}.\n\n\nQuestion: Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?\n\nMegan initially had 1 dozen eggs from the store, which is equal to 12 eggs.\nHer neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, which is another 12 eggs.\nSo Megan had a total of 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 eggs.\nShe used 2 eggs for the omelet and 4 eggs for the cake, so she used a total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 eggs.\nThus, Megan had 24 - 6 = <<24-6=18>>18 eggs left.\nShe gave half of her remaining eggs to her aunt, so she gave 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 eggs to her aunt.\nHence, Megan had 18 - 9 = <<18-9=9>>9 eggs left.\nTherefore, Megan planned to divide her remaining 9 eggs equally for her next 3 meals, so she will have 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 eggs per meal. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: The Rotary Club is holding its annual fundraising Omelet Breakfast, with tickets sold in advance. The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors.

To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?\n", "text": "The small children will need 53 * 0.5 = <<53*0.5=26.5>>26.5 omelets.\nThe older children will need 35 * 1 = <<35*1=35>>35 omelets.\nThe adults will need 75 * 2 = <<75*2=150>>150 omelets.\nThe seniors will need 37 * 1.5 = <<37*1.5=55.5>>55.5 omelets.\nIf we add the extra omelets, they would need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets.\nThey will need to buy 292 * 2 = <<292*2=584>>584 eggs.
