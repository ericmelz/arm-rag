If Jim brought $20 how much did his cousin bring?\n\nThe total bill for the cheeseburgers is 2 * $3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nThe total bill for the milkshakes is 2 * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nThe total bill for the cheese fries is $8.\nThus, the total bill is $6 + $10 + $8 = $<<6+10+8=24>>24.\nLet's say they spent x amount of money, and this means 0.8 * x = $24.\nTherefore, x = $24/0.8 = $<<24/0.8=30>>30.\nThis means Jim and his cousin brought $30 together.\nSince Jim brought $20, his cousin brought $30 - $20 = $<<30-20=10>>10. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Wilson goes to a fast-food restaurant. He buys 2 hamburgers for $5 each and 3 bottles of cola for $2 each. Wilson uses his $4 discount coupon. How much money does he pay in total?\n\nThe total cost of the hamburgers is 2 hamburgers * $5/hamburger = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nThe total cost of the bottles of cola is 3 bottles * $2/bottle = $<<3*2=6>>6.\nThe total cost without the discount is $10 + $6 = $<<10+6=16>>16.\nThus, after using the discount, Wilson pays a total of $16 - $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: Five friends eat at a fast-food chain and order the following: 5 pieces of hamburger that cost $3 each; 4 sets of French fries that cost $1.20; 5 cups of soda that cost $0.5 each; and 1 platter of spaghetti that cost $2.7. How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?\n", "text": "The total cost of the hamburgers is 5 x $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\nThe total cost of the French fries is 4 x $1.20 = $<<4*1.20=4.8>>4.8.\nThe total cost of the sodas is 5 x $0.5 = $<<5*0.5=2.5>>2.5.\nSo, the total bill costs = $15 + $4.8 + $2.5 + $2.7 = $<<15+4.8+2.5+2.7=25>>25.\nTherefore, each of them will pay $25/5 = $<<25/5=5>>5. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}

The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nFor one person's tea, Artemis will use 6 / 8 = <<6/8=0.75>>0.75 ounces of tea.\nThus, for 12 people's tea, Artemis will need 0.75 * 12 = <<0.75*12=9>>9 ounces of tea.

The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?\n\nFirst find the total number of ounces of tea Artemis needs: 1 ounce/cup * 6 cups/person * 12 people = <<1*6*12=72>>72 ounces\nThen multiply that number by the ratio to find the total tea needed: 72 ounces * 1 ounce of tea/8 ounces of tea = <<72*1/8=9>>9 ounces.
