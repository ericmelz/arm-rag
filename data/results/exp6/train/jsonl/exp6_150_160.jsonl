If she needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined, how many meals does she deliver?\n\nLet's call the number of meals Angela delivers M and the number of packages P. We know that Angela needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. So we can write the equation: P = 8M.\nWe also know that Angela needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined. So we can write the equation: P + M = 27.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: 8M + M = 27.\nCombining like terms, we get: 9M = 27.\nDividing both sides by 9, we get: M = 3.\nSo Angela delivers 3 meals.

During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.
