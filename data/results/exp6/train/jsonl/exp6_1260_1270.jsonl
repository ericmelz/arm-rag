She placed the cakes in boxes, and then walked them out to her car.  But she had forgotten her keys.  So, she placed the boxes of cakes in one stack on the hood of her car, and then she ran back into the house to get her keys.  But before she returned, a black crow came, landed on the stack of cakes, and knocked over half of the stack.  When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed.

However, the neighbor who arrived last told Edna there were only 8 cookies left. Edna thinks it was Sarah who took too many cookies. If all the other neighbors took the correct amount of cookies, how many cookies did Sarah take?\n\nSarah took 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 cookies too many.\nTherefore, Sarah took 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12 cookies.

But Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box of crayons. If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box?\n\nIf Karen's box contained 128 crayons, and it had twice as many crayons as were in Beatrice's box, then Beatrice's box contained 128/2 = <<128/2=64>>64 crayons.\nSince Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box, then Gilbert's box contained 64/2 = <<64/2=32>>32 crayons.\nGilbert's box contained four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box, meaning Judah's box had 32/4 =<<32/4=8>>8 crayons.

But Beatrice's box contained twice as many crayons as were in Gilbert's box of crayons. And Gilbert had four times as many crayons as were in Judah's box of crayons. If Karen's box contained 128 crayons, how many crayons were in Judah's box?\n\nLet \"x\" be the number of crayons in Judah's box.\nGilbert's box contained 4*x crayons.\nBeatrice's box contained 2*(4*x) crayons = 8*x crayons.\nKaren's box contained 2*(8*x)=16*x crayons.\nWe know that 16*x=128.\nSo, the number of crayons in Judah's box is x=<<8=8>>8.

Answer: \\boxed{1563}.\n\n\nQuestion: On Tuesday, Liza had $800 in her checking account. On Wednesday, she paid her rent, $450. On Thursday, she deposited her $1500 paycheck. On Friday, she paid her electricity and internet bills which were $117 and $100, respectively. Then on Saturday, she paid her phone bill, $70. How much money is left in Liza's account?\n\nLiza's account had $800 on Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, her rent was $450, so she had $800 - $450 = $<<800-450=350>>350 remaining.\nOn Thursday, she deposited $1500, so her balance became $350 + $1500 = $<<350+1500=1850>>1850.\nOn Friday, she paid $117 + $100 = $<<117+100=217>>217 for her electricity and internet bills.\nTherefore, her balance became $1850 - $217 = $<<1850-217=1633>>1633.\nOn Saturday, she paid $70 for her phone bill.\nSo, her remaining balance is $1633 - $70 = $<<1633-70=1563>>1563.
