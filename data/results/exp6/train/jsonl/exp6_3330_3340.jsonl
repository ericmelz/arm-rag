He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers\u2019 scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers\u2019 scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n\nFirst, we need to convert the weight limit from pounds to ounces since each plate's weight is given in ounces. 20 pounds is equal to 20 * 16 = <<20*16=320>>320 ounces.\nEach plate weighs 10 ounces, so Hasan started with a total weight of 38 * 10 = <<38*10=380>>380 ounces in the box.\nHe needed to remove 380 - 320 = <<380-320=60>>60 ounces to reach the acceptable weight limit.\nSince he removed 1 plate at a time, he needed to remove 60 / 10 = <<60/10=6>>6 plates.

How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n\nEach dinner plate weighs 10 ounces, which is equivalent to 10/16 = <<10/16=0.625>>0.625 pounds.\nTo find out how many plates can be in the box, we need to divide the weight limit of the box by the weight of each plate: 20 pounds / 0.625 pounds/plate = <<20/0.625=32>>32 plates.\nSince Hasan initially had 38 plates in the box, he needs to remove 38 - 32 = <<38-32=6>>6 plates.

When he has removed enough plates, the movers\u2019 scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the weight of each plate in pounds. A pound is equal to 16 ounces, so 10 ounces is equal to 10/16 = 5/8 pounds.\nNext, we need to determine how much weight was in the box originally. Since each plate weighs 5/8 pounds, the weight of 38 plates is 5/8 * 38 = <<5/8*38=23.75>>23.75 pounds.\nTo find out how many plates Hasan needs to remove, we need to determine how much weight remains in the box after removing one plate each time. The weight limit for the box is 20 pounds, so Hasan needs to remove 23.75 - 20 = 3.75 pounds.\nSince each plate weighs 5/8 pounds, Hasan needs to remove 3.75 / (5/8) = 3.75 * (8/5) = 6 plates from the shipping box.

Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n\nFirst, we need to convert the weight limit from pounds to ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in 1 pound, the weight limit is 20 * 16 = <<20*16=320>>320 ounces.\nNext, we need to find the weight of the box without any plates. If each plate weighs 10 ounces, then the weight of the box without any plates is 38 * 10 = <<38*10=380>>380 ounces.\nTo find the number of plates Hasan needs to remove, we subtract the weight of the box without any plates from the weight limit: 380 - 320 = <<380-320=60>>60 ounces.\nSince each plate weighs 10 ounces, Hasan needs to remove 60 / 10 = <<60/10=6>>6 plates from the shipping box.

He still has 16 books to shelve. How many books did he start with in the cart?\n\nJamal shelve 12 + 19 = <<12+19=31>>31 books.\nHe added 4 books so he had 31 + 4 = <<31+4=35>>35 books.\nCounting the 16 books he has left to shelve, he started with 35 + 16 = <<35+16=51>>51 books.
