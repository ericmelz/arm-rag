He pays $2,000 in property taxes, $3,000 in sales taxes, and 10% of his gross salary in income taxes. What is Bill's gross salary?\n\nLet x be Bill's gross salary.\nHis income taxes amount to x * 10% = 0.1x.\nAfter paying all taxes, his take-home salary is x - $2000 - $3000 - 0.1x = 0.9x - $5000.\nSince this amount is $40000, then 0.9x = $45000.\nThus, Bill's gross salary is x = $45000 / 0.9 = $<<45000/0.9=50000>>50000. Answer: \\boxed{50000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bill's take-home salary is $40,000. He pays $2,000 in property taxes, $3,000 in sales taxes, and 10% of his gross salary in income taxes. What is Bill's gross salary?\n\nLet's let x be Bill's gross salary. If Bill pays 10% of his gross salary in income taxes, then he pays 0.10 * x = 0.1x dollars in income taxes.\nAfter paying his income taxes, Bill has x - 0.1x =0.9x dollars.\nIf Bill pays $2,000 in property taxes and $3,000 in sales taxes, then he pays 2000+3000= <<2000+3000=5000>>5000 dollars in property and sales taxes.\nFinally, we know that Bill's take-home salary is $40,000, so that means that 0.9x - 5000 = 40,000.\nAdding 5000 to both sides of the equation, we get 0.9x = 45,000.\nFinally, dividing both sides of the equation by 0.9, we get x = 45,000/0.9 = <<45000/0.9=50000>>50000 dollars.

The rest is taxed at 20%.  How much does he pay in taxes?\n\nThe taxable income is 100,000-30,000=$<<100000-30000=70000>>70,000\nSo he pays 20,000*.1=$<<20000*.1=2000>>2000 at the lower rate\nHe has to pay taxes on 70,000-20,000=$<<70-20=50>>50,000 at the higher rate\nSo he pays 50,000*.2=$<<50000*.2=10000>>10,000 on that income\nSo his total tax bill is 10,000+2,000=$<<10000+2000=12000>>12,000.

His house rental is $640 each month; his monthly food expense is $380; his electric and water bill costs 1/4 of what he makes, and his insurances cost 1/5 of what he makes. How much money does he have left after paying those four bills?\n\nDr. Jones' total monthly expenses are $640 + $380 + ($6,000/4) + ($6,000/5) = $640 + $380 + $1,500 + $1,200 = $<<640+380+1500+1200=3720>>3720.\nTherefore, Dr. Jones has $6,000 - $3,720 = $<<6000-3720=2280>>2280 left after paying those four bills.

How much does Bill get paid for a 50-hour workweek?\n\nFor the 40 hours Bill works, he earns 40*$20=$<<40*20=800>>800.\nFor the additional 10 hours, he earns $20*2=$<<20*2=40>>40 per hour.\nSo for this time, he earns an additional 10*$40=$<<10*40=400>>400.\nThus, in total, for his 50-hour workweek, Bill is paid $800+$400=$<<800+400=1200>>1200. Answer: \\boxed{1200}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bill's take-home salary is $40,000. He pays $2,000 in property taxes, $3,000 in sales taxes, and 10% of his gross salary in income taxes.

If Bill pays 10% of his gross salary in income taxes, then he pays 0.10 * x = 0.1x dollars in income taxes.\nAfter paying his income taxes, Bill has x - 0.1x =0.9x dollars.\nIf Bill pays $2,000 in property taxes and $3,000 in sales taxes, then he pays 2000+3000= <<2000+3000=5000>>5000 dollars in property and sales taxes.\nFinally, we know that Bill's take-home salary is $40,000, so that means that 0.9x - 5000 = 40,000.\nAdding 5000 to both sides of the equation, we get 0.9x = 45,000.\nFinally, dividing both sides of the equation by 0.9, we get x = 45,000/0.9 = <<45000/0.9=50000>>50000 dollars.

The garbage company charges Mary $10 per trash bin and $5 per recycling bin every week, and Mary has 2 trash bins and 1 recycling bin. They're giving her an 18% discount on the whole bill before fines for being elderly, but also charging her a $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin. How much is Mary's garbage bill?\n\nMary pays 2 trash bins * $10 per trash bin = $<<2*10=20>>20 per week for trash bins.\nMary pays 1 recycling bin * $5 per recycling bin = $<<1*5=5>>5 per week for recycling bin.\nMary's monthly bill would be $20 per week * 4 weeks = $<<20*4=80>>80 for trash bins.\nMary's monthly bill would be $5 per week * 4 weeks = $<<5*4=20>>20 for recycling bin.\nThe total charge before fines would equal $80 for the trash + $20 for the recycling = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThe discount would take off $100 * 18% = $<<100*18*.01=18>>18.\nThus, Mary's bill would be $100 - $18 + $20 = $<<100-18+20=102>>102.
