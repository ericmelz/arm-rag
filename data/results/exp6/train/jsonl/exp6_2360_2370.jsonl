Since he wants it for 20 days, he has 20-14 = <<20-14=6>>6 days\nThat means he pays 6*50 = $<<6*50=300.00>>300.00\nSo in total, it will cost him 500+300 = $<<500+300=800.00>>800.00.

He'll have to get a loan for the rest of the amount and make 48 equal monthly payments on it. Each month, he also has to pay interest equal to 5% of that month's payment. How much will Jason's monthly payments be?\n\nFirst find how much the loan amount is: $32,000 - $8,000 = $<<32000-8000=24000>>24,000\nThen divide that amount by the number of payments to find the monthly payment before interest: $24,000 / 48 months = $<<24000/48=500>>500/month\nThen multiply that by 5% to find the monthly interest payment: $500/month * 5% = $<<500*5*.01=25>>25/month\nThen add that amount to the monthly payment amount to find the total monthly cost: $25/month + $500/month = $<<25+500=525>>525/month.

How much will Jason's monthly payments be?\n\nThe loan amount is 32000 - 8000 = $<<32000-8000=24000>>24000.\nEach month, Jason will have to repay 24000 / 48 = $<<24000/48=500>>500.\nSo the interest paid in the first month is 500 * 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.\nTherefore, Jason's monthly payments will amount to 500 + 25 = $<<500+25=525>>525. Answer: \\boxed{525}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason is trying to figure out whether he can afford a new car. The car he wants costs $32,000, and he can make a down payment of $8,000. He'll have to get a loan for the rest of the amount and make 48 equal monthly payments on it. Each month, he also has to pay interest equal to 5% of that month's payment. How much will Jason's monthly payments be?\n\nFirst find the total price Jason has to get a loan for: $32,000 - $8,000 = $<<32000-8000=24000>>24,000\nThen divide the cost of the loan by the number of payments to find the amount of each monthly payment before interest: $24,000 / 48 months = $<<24000/48=500>>500/month\nThen multiply the cost of each payment by 5% to find how much additional money Jason has to pay in interest each month: $500/month * 5% = $<<500*5*.01=25>>25/month\nThen add the cost of each payment to the interest to find the total cost of each payment: $500/month + $25/month = $<<500+25=525>>525/month. Answer: \\boxed{525}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jason has a carriage house that he rents out.  He\u2019s charging $50.00 per day or $500.00 for 14 days.  Eric wants to rent the house for 20 days.  How much will it cost him?\n", "text": "If Eric rents the house for 20 days, he will need to pay for a combination of 14-day rental and a 6-day rental. The cost of a 14-day rental is $500.00. The cost of a 6-day rental is 6 * $50 = $300.00. Thus, the total cost of renting for 20 days is $500 + $300 = $800. Answer: \\boxed{800}."}
