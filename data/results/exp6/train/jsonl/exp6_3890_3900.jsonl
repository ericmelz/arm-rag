How many apples are in the box?\n", "text": "To find the number of apples in the box, we need to determine the number of peaches first. Given that there are half as many peaches as oranges, and we know that one-fourth of the box contains oranges, we can calculate the number of peaches as 1/4 * 56 * 1/2 = 14 * 1/2 = 7 peaches. \n\nNext, we are given that there are five times as many apples as peaches. Therefore, the number of apples in the box is 7 * 5 = 35 apples. \n\nAnswer: \\boxed{35}."}
