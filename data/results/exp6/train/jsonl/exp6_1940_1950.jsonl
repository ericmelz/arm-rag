At the close of business she ended up making $50.  As she went back through her inventory she noticed that she sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades. How many cups of large lemonade did Tonya sell?\n\nLet's represent the number of small lemonades sold as s, medium lemonades as m, and large lemonades as l.\nThe amount of money made from small lemonades is 1s = $11.\nThe amount of money made from medium lemonades is 2m = $24.\nThe total amount of money made is s + 2m + 3l = $50.\nFrom the first equation, s = $11, so s = 11.\nFrom the second equation, m = $12.\nWe know s = 11 and m = 12, so the equation becomes 11 + 24 + 3l = 50.\nSubtracting 11 and 24 from both sides of the equation, we get 3l = 50 - 11 - 24 = 15.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get l = 5.

Answer: \\boxed{50}.\n\n\nQuestion: Alexa has a lemonade stand where she sells lemonade for $2 for one cup. If she spent $20 on ingredients, how many cups of lemonade does she need to sell to make a profit of $80?\n\nAlexa needs to make a profit of $80, which means she needs to earn $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100 in total.\nEach cup of lemonade costs $2, so she needs to sell $100 / $2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cups of lemonade to make a $80 profit. Answer: \\boxed{50}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tonya has opened a lemonade stand selling lemonade in small, medium, and large cups at $1, $2 and $3 respectively. At the close of business she ended up making $50.  As she went back through her inventory she noticed that she sold $11 worth of small lemonades and $24 worth of medium lemonades. How many cups of large lemonade did Tonya sell?\n", "text": "Let S, M, and L represent the number of small, medium, and large cups of lemonade Tonya sold, respectively.\nThe total amount of money she made from selling small lemonades is S * $1 = $11.\nThe total amount of money she made from selling medium lemonades is M * $2 = $24.\nThe total amount of money she made from selling large lemonades is L * $3.\nThe total amount of money she made in total is $11 + $24 + L * $3 = $50.\nSimplifying the equation, we have L * $3 = $50 - $11 - $24 = $15.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $3, we get L = $15 / $3 = 5.\nTherefore, Tonya sold 5 cups of large lemonade. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}
