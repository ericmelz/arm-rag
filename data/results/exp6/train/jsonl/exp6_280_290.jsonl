His monthly bills include $1250 for rent, $150 on utilities, $400 into retirement & savings accounts, $300.00 on groceries/eating out, $200 for insurance and $200 for miscellaneous expenses.  If he\u2019s looking at buying a car with a monthly car payment of $350 how much does that leave for gas and maintenance?\n\nKyle's total monthly expenses are $1250 + $150 + $400 + $300 + $200 + $200 = $<<1250+150+400+300+200+200=2500>>2500.\nHis monthly income minus his monthly expenses is $3200 - $2500 = $<<3200-2500=700>>700.\nAfter paying for his car loan, he has $700 - $350 = $<<700-350=350>>350 remaining for gas and maintenance. Answer: \\boxed{350}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bran's tuition fee is $90. He does a part-time job that pays him $15 per month and he has a scholarship that takes care of 30% of his tuition fee. If he needs to pay his tuition fee within 3 months, how much does Bran still need to pay?\n", "text": "Bran's scholarship covers 30% of his tuition fee, which is $90 x 30/100 = $27.\nSo, he still needs to pay $90 - $27 = $63.\nBran's part-time job pays him $15 x 3 = $45 in 3 months.\nTherefore, Bran still needs to pay $63 - $45 = $18.
