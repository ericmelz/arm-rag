If each m&m pack contains 40 m&ms, how many m&m packs does Kekai use?\n\nOn Monday, Kekai uses 40 sundaes x 6 m&ms/sundae= <<40*6=240>>240 m&ms.\nOn Tuesday, Kekai uses 20 sundaes x 10 m&ms/sundae= <<20*10=200>>200 m&ms.\nIn total, Kekai uses 240 m&ms + 200 m&ms = <<240+200=440>>440 m&ms.\nKekai needs 440 m&ms / 40 m&ms/pack = <<440/40=11>>11 m&m packs.
