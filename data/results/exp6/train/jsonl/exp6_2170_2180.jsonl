If Lexie is 8, what is the age difference between her brother and her sister?\n\nIf Lexie is 8, her brother is 8-6=<<8-6=2>>2 years old.\nHer sister is 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 years old.\nThe age difference between her sister and brother is 16-2=<<16-2=14>>14 years. Answer: \\boxed{14}.\n\n\nQuestion: Maiya has two sisters. The first sister is twice as old as Maiya. The first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya. Their average age is 5. How old is Maiya?\n", "text": "Let's assume Maiya's age is M.\nThe first sister is 2M years old.\nThe second sister is M-1 years old.\nThe total age of the three sisters is M + 2M + M-1 = 4M-1\nAccording to the given information, the average age is 5: (4M-1)/3 = 5\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 3, we get 4M-1 = 15\nAdding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get 4M = 16\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get M = 4\nTherefore, Maiya is 4 years old. Answer: \\boxed{4}."}

He paid $100 for it. After six months, the value of the mower dropped by about 25%. Over the next year, the value of the mower dropped another 20% in value. How much is Ben's lawnmower worth after this time?\n\nAfter six months, the lawnmower dropped in value by 25%, which means it decreased by 25/100 * $100 = $<<25/100*100=25>>25.\nSo its value after six months is $100 - $25 = $<<100-25=75>>75.\nThe next year the lawnmower dropped in value by 20%, which means it decreased by 20/100 * $75 = $<<20/100*75=15>>15.\nSo its value after one year is $75 - $15 = $<<75-15=60>>60.
