The distance between the 2 different US states increases by 40% if someone decides to drive instead of flying. Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York. How far away is Missouri from New York if someone decides to go by car?\n\nIf the distance between Arizona and New York by plane is 2,000 miles, and the distance increases by 40% if someone drives, then the distance by car is 2,000 + 40% of 2,000 = 2,000 + 0.4 * 2,000 = 2,000 + 800 = 2,800 miles.\nSince Missouri is midway between Arizona and New York, the distance between Missouri and New York would be half of the distance between Arizona and New York by car. Therefore, Missouri is 2,800 / 2 = <<2800/2=1400>>1,400 miles away from New York if someone decides to go by car.

The garbage company charges Mary $10 per trash bin and $5 per recycling bin every week, and Mary has 2 trash bins and 1 recycling bin. They're giving her an 18% discount on the whole bill before fines for being elderly, but also charging her a $20 fine for putting inappropriate items in a recycling bin. How much is Mary's garbage bill?\n", "text": "Mary pays $10 per trash bin * 2 trash bins = $<<10*2=20>>20 per week for trash bins.\nMary pays $5 per recycling bin * 1 recycling bin = $<<5*1=5>>5 per week for recycling bin.\nMary's monthly bill would be $20 per week * 4 weeks = $<<20*4=80>>80 for trash bins.\nMary's monthly bill would be $5 per week * 4 weeks = $<<5*4=20>>20 for recycling bin.\nThe total charge before fines would equal $80 for the trash + $20 for the recycling = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThe discount would take off $100 * 18% = $<<100*18*.01=18>>18.\nThus, Mary's bill would be $100 - $18 + $20 = $<<100-18+20=102>>102. Answer: \\boxed{102}."}
