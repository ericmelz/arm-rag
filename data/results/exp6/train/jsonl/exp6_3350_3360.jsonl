When Chastity returned, she picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, but the rest of the cakes were destroyed.  How many cakes were destroyed?\n\nThere were 12 angel food cakes in total.\nHalf of the stack was knocked over by the black crow, so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cakes were knocked over.\nChastity picked up half of the fallen cakes, which were not damaged, so 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 cakes were picked up.\nTherefore, the remaining cakes were destroyed, which means 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cakes were destroyed. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Angel has written letters to all of her pen pals and is putting all of the letters in envelopes. Most of the letters are put into large envelopes and the remaining 20 letters are put into small envelopes. The large envelopes each contain 2 letters each. If Angel has written a total of 80 letters, how many large envelopes did she use?\n", "text": "Angel wrote a total of 80 letters. Out of these, 20 were put into small envelopes. Therefore, the number of letters put into large envelopes is 80 - 20 = 60. Each large envelope contains 2 letters, so she used 60/2 = 30 large envelopes. Answer: \\boxed{30}."}
