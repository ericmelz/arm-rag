How many hours does she have to work to earn $70?\n\nIf Nancy earns $28 for working 4 hours, she earns $28/4 = $<<28/4=7>>7 per hour.\nSo, Nancy has to work for $70/$7 = <<70/7=10>>10 hours to earn $70. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Nancy earns $28 for working 4 hours. How many hours does she have to work to earn $70?\n\nLet x be the number of hours Nancy has to work to earn $70.\nWe can set up the proportion: 28/4 = 70/x.\nCross-multiplying gives us 28x = 4 * 70.\nDividing both sides by 28 gives us x = (4 * 70) / 28.\nSimplifying further gives us x = 10.\nTherefore, Nancy has to work 10 hours to earn $70.

He only needs 17 more points to tie the record. By the end of the game, Duke breaks the record by 5 points. The old record was 257 points. In the final game Duke made 5 free throws (worth one point), and 4 regular baskets (worth two points), and some three-pointers. Normally, he scores 2 three-pointers a game. How many more three-pointers did he score in the final game compared to his normal amount?\n\nDuke needed 17 more points to tie the record and breaks it by 5 points, so he scored 17+5=<<17+5=22>>22 points in the final game.\nThe only baskets he made were 5 free throws (1 point each) and 4 regular baskets (2 points each) for a total of 5+4(2) = <<5+4(2)=13>>13 points.\nSince he scored 22 points and only 13 of those points were from baskets, that means 22-13 = <<22-13=9>>9 points were from three-pointers.\nSince a three-pointer is worth 3 points, that means he scored 9/3= <<9/3=3>>3 three-pointers in the final game.\nHis normal amount is 2 three-pointers a game so he made 3-2 = <<3-2=1>>1 more three-pointer than normal.

His brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them. How many points does Reggie lose by?\n\nReggie scores 3 points for his layups because 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3\nHe scores 4 points for his free throws because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4\nHe scores 3 points for his long shot because 1 x 3= <<1*3=3>>3\nAll together, Reggie scores 10 points because 3 + 4 + 3 = <<3+4+3=10>>10\nReggie's brother scores 12 points because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12\nReggie loses by 2 points because 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2.

He still owes another $2000 on his new car. How much did his old car cost, in dollars?\n\nLet X be the cost of the old car.\nSo the new car cost X*2 dollars.\nHe sold his old car for $1800, and that paid off X*1800/X = 1800 dollars.\nSo the new car cost X*2 - 1800 = $2000.\nThat means 2X = 3800.\nTherefore, the old car cost X = 3800 / 2 = $<<1900=1900>>1900. Answer: \\boxed{1900}.\n\n\nQuestion: James decides to replace his car.  He sold his $20,000 car for 80% of its value and then was able to haggle to buy a $30,000 sticker price car for 90% of its value.  How much was he out of pocket?\n\nHe got 20000*.8=$<<20000*.8=16000>>16,000\nHe was able to buy it for 30000*.9=$<<30000*.9=27000>>27,000\nSo he had to pay 27000-16000=$<<27000-16000=11000>>11,000 out of pocket.
