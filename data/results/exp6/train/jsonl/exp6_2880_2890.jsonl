If there are 210 fingers in the salon at 2 pm, and everyone has 10 fingers, how many people in the salon are not clients?\n\nThe salon does 200/20= <<200/20=10>>10 customers\nEveryone in a salon has 210/10=<<210/10=21>>21 fingers.\nThis means in the salon there are 21-10=<<21-10=11>>11 people not having their nails done. Answer: \\boxed{11}.\n\n\nQuestion: A nail salon was completely booked at 2 pm for manicures.  Each manicure costs $20.00 per client so the salon made $200.00.  If there are 210 fingers in the salon at 2 pm, and everyone has 10 fingers, how many people in the salon are not clients?\n\nWe start with the number of fingers in the salon which is 210 and every person has 10 fingers so there were 210/10 = <<210/10=21>>21 people\nThe number of clients at the salon was 21 and each client was charged $20.00 for a total of 21*20 = $<<21*20=420.00>>420.00\nIf we subtract the money made by clients, $200.00, from the salon's total of $420.00 we get 420-200 = $<<420-200=220.00>>220.00\nWe were trying to find how many people in the salon are not clients and we see that there is $220 left in revenue to take account of so we divide 220 by $20.00, the cost per client and we get 220/20 = <<220/20=11>>11 people in the salon are not clients.

She has 5 1.5 hours appointments on Monday, a 3-hours appointment on Tuesday and 2 2-hours appointments on Thursday.  On Saturday, she will spend 6 hours at one client's house.  How much money will she make this week?\n\nOn Monday, she will spend 5*1.5=<<5*1.5=7.5>>7.5 hours\nThus, on Monday, she will make 7.5*$20.00=$<<7.5*20=150.00>>150.00\nOn Tuesday, she will make 3*$20.00=$<<3*20=60.00>>60.00\nOn Thursday, she will make 2*2*$20.00=$<<2*2*20=80.00>>80.00\nSaturday, she will make 6*$20.00=$<<6*20=120.00>>120.00\nThe total amount of money she will earn for the week is $150.00+$60.00+$80.00+$120.00=$<<150+60+80+120=410.00>>410.00.

She has 5 1.5 hours appointments on Monday, a 3-hours appointment on Tuesday and 2 2-hours appointments on Thursday.  On Saturday, she will spend 6 hours at one client's house.  How much money will she make this week?\n\nOn Monday, she has 5 1.5 hours appointments so that's 5*1.5 = <<5*1.5=7.5>>7.5 hours\nShe will charge $20.00 per hour and she works 7.5 hours on Monday so she will make 20*7.5 = $<<20*7.5=150.00>>150.00 on Monday\nOn Tuesday, she will charge $20.00 per hour and work 3 hours so she will make 20*3 = $<<20*3=60.00>>60.00 on Tuesday\nOn Thursday, she will have 2, 2-hour appointments so that's 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours\nShe charges $20.00 per hour and will work 4 hours so she will make 20*4 = $<<20*4=80.00>>80.00 on Thursday\nOn Saturday she will spend 6 hours at a client's house and she charges $20.00 per hour so she will make 20*6 = $<<20*6=120.00>>120.00\nBetween Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday she will make 150+60+80+120 = $<<150+60+80+120=410.00>>410.00. Answer: \\boxed{410}.\n\n\nQuestion: A nail salon was completely booked at 2 pm for manicures.  Each manicure costs $20.00 per client so the salon made $200.00.  If there are 210 fingers in the salon at 2 pm, and everyone has 10 fingers, how many people in the salon are not clients?\n", "text": "We can start by finding the number of clients in the salon. Since there are 210 fingers in the salon and each person has 10 fingers, there must be 210/10 = 21 people. \n\nNext, we can calculate the total amount of sales for the day. Each manicure costs $20.00 per client, so the total sales would be 21 * $20.00 = $420.00.\n\nSince the salon made $200.00 in sales, we can find the amount of money made by non-clients by subtracting $200.00 from $420.00. This gives us $420.00 - $200.00 = $220.00.\n\nTo determine the number of people in the salon who are not clients, we divide the revenue made by non-clients ($220.00) by the cost per client ($20.00). This gives us $220.00 / $20.00 = 11 people.\n\nTherefore, there are 11 people in the salon who are not clients. Answer: \\boxed{11}."}

If 83% of the guests RSVP with a Yes response and 9% of the guests RSVP with a No response, how many guests did not respond at all?\n\nOf the 200 guests, 83% RSVP with Yes, so .83*200 = <<83*.01*200=166>>166 guests RSVP with Yes.\nOf the 200 guests, 9% RSVP with No, so .09*200 = <<9*.01*200=18>>18 guests RSVP with No.\nTogether, 166+18 = <<166+18=184>>184 guests responded to the invitation.\nThus, 200-184 = <<200-184=16>>16 guests did not respond at all.
