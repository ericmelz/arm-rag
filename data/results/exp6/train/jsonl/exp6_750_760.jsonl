If the area is 100 m2. what is the length of the rectangle?\n\nLet x be the width of the rectangle.\nSince the length is four times the width, the length of the rectangle is 4x.\nThe area of the rectangle is given by length * width, so we have 4x * x = 100 m^2.\nSimplifying, we get 4x^2 = 100.\nDividing both sides by 4, we have x^2 = 25.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have x = 5 or x = -5.\nSince the dimensions of a rectangle cannot be negative, the width of the rectangle is 5 units.\nThe length of the rectangle is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
