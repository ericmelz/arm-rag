Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's first find out how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the last hundred years. We know that over the three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people, and each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Let's assume there were X people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nSince each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the second hundred years is 2*X.\nAnd the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the third hundred years is 2*2*X = 4*X.\n\nTherefore, over the three hundred years, the total number of people consumed by the monster is X + 2*X + 4*X = 7*X = 847.\nTo find X, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: X = 847/7 = <<847/7=121>>121.\n\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.

Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom goes to a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.  It takes 3 years to finish the BS and 5 years to finish the Ph.D.  Tom finishes it in 3/4ths the time.  How long does it take for him to finish?\n\nNormally getting both degrees would take 3+5=<<3+5=8>>8 years\nSo he finishes in 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 years. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom goes to a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.  It takes 3 years to finish the BS and 5 years to finish the Ph.D.  Tom finishes it in 3/4ths the time.

Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: John decides to go back to school to get his PhD.  He first takes 1 year of courses to get acclimated back to school life before starting his PhD.  After that, he spends 2 years learning the basics of his field.  He then starts research, and he spends 75% more time on research than he did learning the basics.  He then spends half as long on writing his dissertation as his acclimation period.  How long did it take him to do everything?\n", "text": "He spends 2*.75=<<2*.75=1.5>>1.5 years more on research than he did learning the basics.\nSo he spent 2+1.5=<<2+1.5=3.5>>3.5 years on research.\nHe spent 1/2=<<1/2=0.5>>0.5 years writing his dissertation.\nSo in total, he spent 1+2+3.5+0.5=<<1+2+3.5+0.5=7>>7 years on everything.

If she will transfer all her files to a new external drive of size 20 gigabytes, how many free gigabytes will the new external drive have?\n\nAfter deleting a folder of 4.6 gigabytes, the used space on Sarah's external drive decreased to 12.6 - 4.6 = <<12.6-4.6=8>>8 gigabytes.\nAfter storing new files of 2 gigabytes, the used space on her external drive increased to 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 gigabytes.\nTherefore, the free space on her external drive decreased to 20 - 10 = <<20-10=10>>10 gigabytes.
