If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?\n\nIn a year without a leap year, there are 365 days. \n\nTo find the number of comics James has written in a year, we divide the number of days in a year by the frequency (every other day). \n\n365 days / 2 = 182.5 comics per year.\n\nTherefore, in 4 years, he has written 4 years * 182.5 comics/year = <<4*182.5=730>>730 comics.

They also received a shipment of 160 books. How many books do they currently have?\n\nOn Saturday, the bookshop sold 37 + 128 = <<37+128=165>>165 books.\nOn Sunday, the shop sold 2 * 37 = <<2*37=74>>74 books in-store.\nThey sold 128 + 34 = <<128+34=162>>162 books online on Sunday.\nSo, they sold a total of 74 + 162 = <<74+162=236>>236 books on Sunday.\nThus, the total number of books sold over the weekend is 165 + 236 = <<165+236=401>>401.\nThe bookshop received a new shipment of 160 books, so they now have 743 - 401 + 160 = <<743-401+160=502>>502 books.

On Sunday, he goes to church and comes back, sits down, and reads 20 pages of the book. How many pages are remaining before Jerry can finish the book?\n\nIf he reads 30 pages on Saturday, the number of pages remaining to read from the book becomes 93-30 = <<93-30=63>>63 pages.\nWhen he reads 20 pages on Sunday, the number of pages remaining to read from the book becomes 63-20 = <<63-20=43>>43 pages. Answer: \\boxed{43}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a certain bookstore, the best-selling book, \"TOP,\" costs $8. The least-selling book, \"ABC,\" costs $23. Thirteen \"TOP\" books and four \"ABC\" books were sold last week. What is the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week?\n\nThe earnings from selling \"TOP\" books would be 13 x $8 = $<<13*8=104>>104.\nThe earning from selling \"ABC\" books would be 4 x $23 = $<<4*23=92>>92.\nThe difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week is $104 - $92 = $<<104-92=12>>12. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: Nico borrows 3 books from the library on Monday.  On Monday, he reads the first book with a total of 20 pages.  On Tuesday, he reads the second book with a total of 12 pages.  On Wednesday, he reads the third book.  If he has read a total of 51 pages from Monday to Wednesday, how many pages did he read on Wednesday?\n\nOn Monday, he reads 20 pages and on Tuesday, he reads 12 pages so he has read 20+12 = <<20+12=32>>32 pages total\nTherefore, on Wednesday, he read 51-32 = <<51-32=19>>19 pages.

How much money did Noemi begin with if she still had $800 in her purse?\n\nLet's assume Noemi began with x dollars.\nAfter losing $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack, she had $x - $400 - $500 = $<<x-400-500=x-900>>x-900 left.\nSince she still had $800 in her purse, we can then write the equation: $x - 900 = $800.\nAdding $900 to both sides, we find $x = $900 + $800 = $<<900+800=1700>>1700.\nNoemi began with $1700. Answer: \\boxed{1700}.\n\n\nQuestion: John is holding a poker night with his friends and is getting the decks of cards ready before his friends show up. After losing so many cards from various decks, John thinks he needs to count exactly how many cards he has to make sure he has enough full decks for the night. Each deck of cards should hold 52 cards. He finds 3 half-full decks of cards and 3 full decks of cards. As he is arranging them, he realizes that the quality of a lot of the cards is quite poor and decides to throw 34 of the cards in the trash. How many cards does John now have?\n\nJohn starts with 3 half-full decks of cards, so there are half of 52 cards per deck which is 52 / 2 = <<52/2=26>>26 cards in each half-full deck.\nIf there are 3 half-full decks, then John has 26 * 3 = <<26*3=78>>78 cards from the half-full decks.\nHe also has 3 full decks, which is 3 * 52 = <<3*52=156>>156 cards from the three full decks.\nHe then throws away 34 of the cards, so now he has a total of 78 + 156 - 34 = <<78+156-34=200>>200 cards. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: Noemi lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack. How much money did Noemi begin with if she still had $800 in her purse?\n\nNoemi lost a total of $400 + $500 = $<<400+500=900>>900.\nTherefore, he began with $800 + $900 = $<<800+900=1700>>1700. Answer: \\boxed{1700}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark went to a store where he spent one-half of his money, and then spent $14 more. He then went to another store where he spent one-third of his starting money, and then spent $16 more. If he then had no money left, how much did he have when he entered the first store?\n\nLet X be the amount Mark had when entering the first store.\nHe spent 1/2*X + 14 in the first store.\nHe had X - (1/2*X + 14) = 1/2*X - 14 left.\nHe spent 1/3*X + 16 in the second store.\nHe had 1/2*X - 14 - (1/3*X + 16) = -1/6*X - 30 left.\nSince he had nothing left, -1/6*X - 30 = 0.\nThus, -1/6*X = 30.\nHence, X = -30 / -1/6 = <<30*(-1)/(1/6)=180>>180 dollars. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Noemi lost $400 on roulette and $500 on blackjack. How much money did Noemi begin with if she still had $800 in her purse?\n\nNoemi lost $400 + $500 = $<<400+500=900>>900 in total.\nTherefore, Noemi initially had $900 + $800 = $<<900+800=1700>>1700. Answer: \\boxed{1700}.\n\n\nQuestion: A casino table pays 3:2 if you get a blackjack with your first 2 cards. If you scored a blackjack and were paid $60, what was your original bet?\n", "text": "Let's assume the original bet was x dollars.\nIf you were paid 3:2 for a blackjack, it means you received 3 parts for every 2 parts of your original bet. In this case, you received $60 for your blackjack, which represents 3 parts.\nTherefore, the original bet (x) is equal to 2 parts, which can be calculated using the proportion: 3 parts = $60, 2 parts = x dollars.\nUsing cross multiplication, we have: 3x = 2 * $60.\nSimplifying, we find: 3x = $120.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get: x = $40.\nYour original bet was $40. Answer: \\boxed{40}."}
