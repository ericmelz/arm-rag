Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?\n\nManny will eat 1 piece. \nAaron will eat 0 pieces. \nKai will eat 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pieces.\nRaphael will eat 1 / 2 = <<1/2=0.5>>0.5 pieces.\nLisa will eat 2 + 0.5 = <<2+0.5=2.5>>2.5 pieces.\nIn total, they will eat 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 = <<1+0+2+0.5+2.5=6>>6 pieces.\nTherefore, Manny should cut his lasagna into 6 pieces.
