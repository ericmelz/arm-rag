Therefore, after the first cut, she donates 100/2 = <<100/2=50>>50 square inches of cloth.\nAfter the second cut, she donates another 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 square inches of cloth.\nTherefore, Fatima will have donated a total of 50 + 25 = <<50+25=75>>75 square inches of cloth.

If she does this 2 times, then how much cloth will she have donated?\n\nEach time Fatima cuts the cloth in half, she will be left with half of the original amount. So after the first cut, she will have 100/2 = <<100/2=50>>50 square inches of cloth.\nAfter the second cut, she will have 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 square inches of cloth.\nTherefore, Fatima will have donated a total of 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 square inches of cloth.
