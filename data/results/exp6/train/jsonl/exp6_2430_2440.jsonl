How many dollars remain in the account?\n\nEmma spends $8 each day for a total of 7*8 = <<8*7=56>>56 dollars\nAt the end of the week, Emma has $100 - $56 = <<100-56=44>>44 left\nEmma can take out $5 bills in 44/5 = <<44/5=8>>8 bills\nEmma is left with $44 - $5*8 = $<<44-5*8=4>>4. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: Emma got $2000 from the bank. She bought $400 of furniture and gave 3/4 of the rest to her friend Anna. How much is left with Emma?\n\nEmma had $2000 - $400 = $<<2000-400=1600>>1600 left.\nEmma gave $1600 x 3/4 = $<<1600*3/4=1200>>1200 to Anna.\nTherefore, Emma had $1600 - $1200 = $<<1600-1200=400>>400 left with her.
