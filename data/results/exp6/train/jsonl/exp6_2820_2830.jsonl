Answer: \\boxed{5500}.\n\n\nQuestion: In five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital that he is hired into. If Grant is currently 25 years old, how old is the hospital now?\n", "text": "In five years, Grant will be 25 + 5 = <<25+5=30>>30 years old.\nLet's assume that x is the current age of the hospital.\nSo in five years, the hospital will be x + 5 years old.\nAccording to the problem, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital in five years, which means Grant's age in five years is 2/3 * (x + 5).\nSo we have the equation 2/3 * (x + 5) = 30.\nBy cross-multiplication, we get 2(x + 5) = 3 * 30.\nThus, 2x + 10 = 90.\nTherefore, 2x = 90 - 10 = 80.\nSo the current age of the hospital is x = 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 years old.
