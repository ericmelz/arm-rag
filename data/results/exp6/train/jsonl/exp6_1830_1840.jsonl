On the way, their father bought a packet of 36 candies. He gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb and the rest to Andy. How many more candies does Andy now have than Caleb?\n\nBilly got 6 candies initially and his father gave him an additional 8 candies, a total of 6+8 = <<6+8=14>>14 candies.\nCaleb received 11 candies initially and his dad gave him 11 more, a total of 11+11 = <<11+11=22>>22 candies.\nAltogether, Caleb has 22+14 = <<22+14=36>>36 candies.\nHis father gave out a total of 8+11 = <<8+11=19>>19 candies to his brothers.\nIf the rest of the candies were given to Andy, he got 36-(8+11) = <<36-(8+11)=17>>17 candies from their father.\nAndy now has 17+9 = <<17+9=26>>26 candies.\nHe has 26-22 = <<26-22=4>>4 more candies than Caleb.

On the way, their father bought a packet of 36 candies. He gave 8 candies to Billy, 11 to Caleb and the rest to Andy. How many more candies does Andy now have than Caleb?\n\nBilly received 8 candies from his father, so he now has 6 + 8 = <<6+8=14>>14 candies.\nCaleb has 11 candies + 11 candies from his father = <<11+11=22>>22 candies.\nTogether, Caleb and Billy have 14 candies + 22 candies = <<14+22=36>>36 candies.\nThe father therefore gave out 36 candies from the packet.\nThis means Andy was given 36 candies \u2013 8 candies \u2013 11 candies = <<36-8-11=17>>17 candies.\nAndy now has 9 candies + 17 candies = <<9+17=26>>26 candies.\nAndy therefore has 26 candies \u2013 22 candies = <<26-22=4>>4 candies more than Caleb. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy.  If Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then how many pencils does Candy have?\n\nIf Calen lost 10 pencils, which left him with 10 pencils, then originally he had 10+10 = <<10+10=20>>20 pencils.\nCalen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, thus Caleb originally had 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pencils.\nCaleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy; if Candy has x pencils, then Caleb has 2*x-3 pencils.\nWe know that originally Caleb had 15 pencils, therefore 2*x-3 = 15\n2*x = <<15+3=18>>18\nx = 18/2\nx = <<9=9>>9 Candies have 9 pencils.

If his daily goal is 10,000 steps, how many minutes will it take him to reach his goal?\n\nHe walks 2000 steps in 30 minutes and his goal is 10,000 steps so he needs to walk 10,000/2,000 = <<10000/2000=5>>5 sets of 30 minutes\nEach set is 30 minutes and he needs to complete 5 sets so it will take him 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes.

If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\n\nTo find the average speed of his return journey, we need to calculate the distance he travels in the evening first.\n\nIn the morning, he drives for 1 hour at an average speed of 30mph, so he covers a distance of 1 * 30 = <<1*30=30>>30 miles.\n\nIn the evening, he drives for 1.5 hours. Since the distance traveled in both morning and evening is the same, he covers a distance of 30 miles in 1.5 hours, giving an average speed of 30/1.5 = <<30/1.5=20>>20mph.
