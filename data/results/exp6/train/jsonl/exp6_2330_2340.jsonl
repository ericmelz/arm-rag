Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?\n\nThe first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 1.5 hours.\nThe second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 hours long.\nSo the total movie time is 1.5 + 2 = <<1.5+2=3.5>>3.5 hours.\nThey spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, which is 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.\nSo the total cooking time is 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes.\nTherefore, it took them a total of 3.5 + 0.5 = <<3.5+0.5=4>>4 hours to cook and watch the movies.
