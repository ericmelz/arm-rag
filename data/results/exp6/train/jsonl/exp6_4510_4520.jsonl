If each bushel contains 48 apples, then how much profit, in dollars, does he make after selling 100 apples?\n\nHe buys the apples at $12 per bushel, so at a rate of 48 apples per bushel, this means he buys the apples at a rate of 12/48 = $<<12/48=0.25>>0.25 per apple.\nHe sells the apples at $0.40 per apple, thus he makes a profit of 0.40-0.25 = $<<0.40-0.25=0.15>>0.15 per apple.\nAt 0.15 profit per apple, after selling 100 of them Bronson makes a profit of 100*0.15 = $<<100*0.15=15>>15.

Delivery and tip came to a total of $8.00.  How much is his new bill now, with the food substitutes and delivery/tip?\n\nThe original cost of the groceries was $25. When he made his changes, the tomatoes were $2.20 instead of $0.99, the lettuce was $1.75 instead of $1.00, and the celery was $2.00 instead of $1.96.\nThe combined difference of ($2.20 - $0.99) + ($1.75 - $1.00) + ($2.00 - $1.96) = $1.21 + $0.75 + $0.04 = $2.00.\nThe new cost of the groceries was the original amount of $25 plus the new amount of $2.00, so $25 + $2.00 = $<<25+2=27>>27.\nThe delivery and tip cost was $8.00.\nThus, his new total bill was $27 + $8 = $<<27+8=35>>35.

He noticed that 3 items changed on his order.  A $0.99 can of tomatoes was replaced by a $2.20 can of tomatoes, his $1.00 lettuce was replaced with $1.75 head of lettuce and his $1.96 celery was replaced with celery that cost $2.00.  Delivery and tip came to a total of $8.00.  How much is his new bill now, with the food substitutes and delivery/tip?\n\nThe substitute tomatoes were $2.20 but the original ones were $0.99 so that's an increase of 2.20-.99 = $<<2.20-.99=1.21>>1.21\nThe substitute lettuce was $1.75 but the original one was $1.00 so that's an increase of 1.75-1.00 = $<<1.75-1.00=0.75>>0.75\nThe substitute celery was $2.00 but the original celery was $1.96 so that's an increase of 2.00-1.96 = $<<2.00-1.96=0.04>>0.04\nThe substituted food cost an additional 1.21+0.75+0.04 = $<<1.21+0.75+0.04=2.00>>2.00\nThe food order of $25.00 had 3 substitutions that cost an additional $2.00 and the delivery/tip was $8.00 so the new bill total was 25+2+8 = $<<25+2+8=35.00>>35.00.

The mom ordered lobster for $25.50, the dad ordered steak for $35.00 their twin boys both ordered a cheeseburger and fries for $13.50 each.  They started their meal with an appetizer that cost 8.50.  Everyone also ordered a dessert that cost $6.00 each.  They wanted to give a 20% tip for Zach on the bill.  What did the final bill total come to?\n\nThe mom and dad ordered for $25.50 + 35 = $<<25.50+35=60.50>>60.50.\nThe twins' orders cost $13.50 x 2 = $<<13.50*2=27>>27.\nThe dessert is $6 x 4 = $<<6*4=24>>24.\nThe meals came to $60.50 + $8.50 + $27 +$24 = $<<60.5+8.5+27+24=120>>120.\nThe tip came to $120 x 20% = $<<120*20*.01=24>>24.\nThe final bill cost $120 + $24 = $<<120+24=144>>144. Answer: \\boxed{144}.\n\n\nQuestion: Allen ordered five boxes of pizza, which cost $7 each box. He then gave a tip which amounts to 1/7 of the total cost of his order. If he gave the delivery man $100, how much change did he receive?\n\nAllen spent 5 x $7 = $<<5*7=35>>35 for his orders.\nHis tip amounts to $35 x 1/7 = $<<35*1/7=5>>5.\nTherefore, the total amount he gave is $35 + $5 = $<<35+5=40>>40.\nHence, his change is $100 - $40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
