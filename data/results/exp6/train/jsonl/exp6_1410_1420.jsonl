Since Mario is 1 year older than Maria, his age would be (x+1).\nThe sum of Mario and Maria's ages now is 7, so we can write the equation as:\nx + (x+1) = 7\nCombining like terms: 2x + 1 = 7\nSubtracting 1 from both sides: 2x = 6\nDividing both sides by 2: x = 6/2\nTherefore, Maria's age (x) is 3 years and Mario's age (x+1) is 3+1 = 4 years. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: The sum of Mario and Maria's ages now is 7. Mario is 1 year older than Maria. How old is Mario?\n\nLet's assume Maria's age as M years.\nAccording to the given conditions, Mario is 1 year older than Maria, so Mario's age is M + 1 years.\nThe sum of their ages is 7, so we can write the equation as:\nM + (M + 1) = 7\n2M + 1 = 7\nSubtracting 1 from both sides of the equation:\n2M = 7 - 1\n2M = 6\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2:\nM = 6/2\nM = 3\nTherefore, Maria is 3 years old.\nAs Mario is 1 year older than Maria, Mario's age is 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 years old.\nSo, Mario is 4 years old. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: Maria's birthday is in 22 days. Her friend Lilly wants to buy her flowers so she saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday. If a flower costs $4, how many flowers can she buy?\n\nLilly will save $2 x 22 = $<<2*22=44>>44.\nShe can buy $44/$4 = <<44/4=11>>11 flowers. Answer: \\boxed{11}.\n\n\nQuestion: The sum of Mario and Maria's ages now is 7. Mario is 1 year older than Maria. How old is Mario?\n", "text": "Let's assume Mario's age is x years.\nSince Mario is 1 year older than Maria, Maria's age would be (x-1) years.\nThe sum of their ages is 7, so we can write the equation as:\nx + (x-1) = 7\nCombining like terms: 2x - 1 = 7\nAdding 1 to both sides: 2x = 8\nDividing both sides by 2: x = 4\nTherefore, Mario's age is 4 years.

The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?\n\nMaria will be able to buy a set of brushes, which cost 20, for $20.\nMaria wants to buy a canvas for three times more than the brush which means she will have to pay 3 * 20 = $<<3*20=60>>60 for the canvas.\nShe needs at least 5 liters of paint which she can buy for 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Maria will need 40 + 60 + 20 = $<<40+60+20=120>>120 to buy everything she needs for the painting.\nSo she will earn 200 - 120 = $<<200-120=80>>80 on the painting.
