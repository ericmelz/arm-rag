Answer: \\boxed{14}.\n\n\nQuestion: Marcia's hair is 24\" long at the beginning of the school year.  She cuts half of her hair off and lets it grow out 4 more inches.  She then cuts off another 2\" of hair.  How long is her hair?\n\nMarcia cuts off half of her hair, so the length of hair she cuts off is 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12\".\nThus, her hair is 24-12 = <<24-12=12>>12\" long.\nMarcia lets her hair grow out 4 inches, so she now has 12+4 = <<12+4=16>>16\" of hair.\nMarcia then cuts off 2\" of her hair, leaving her with 16-2 = <<16-2=14>>14\" of hair. Answer: \\boxed{14}.\n\n\nQuestion: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors. Her hair is 14 inches long. She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig. She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation. How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\n", "text": "Patricia's hair is currently 14 inches long. After the donation, she wants her hair to be 12 inches long. This means she will be donating 14 - 12 = 2 inches of her hair. \nIn order to make a wig, she needs to donate a total of 23 inches. Therefore, Patricia still needs to grow her hair for an additional 23 - 2 = 21 inches. Answer: \\boxed{21}."}

Matt got twice as many apples, and Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. How many fruits do the three children have in total?\n\nIf Mike received 3 oranges, the total number of oranges is 3 oranges.\nMatt got twice as many apples, a total of 2 * 3 oranges = <<2*3=6>>6 apples.\nThe total number of fruits that Mike and Matt got is 6 apples + 3 oranges = <<6+3=9>>9 fruits.\nMark received the same number of bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether, so he got 9 fruits.\nIn total, the three children have 9 fruits + 9 fruits = <<9+9=18>>18 fruits.
