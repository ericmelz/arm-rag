If he has 342 coconuts and he wants to convert all of them into goats, how many goats will he have?\n", "text": "Max can trade 3 coconuts for a crab and 6 crabs for a goat. To determine how many goats Max can get, we divide the number of coconuts by the number of coconuts needed for one goat. Since Max has 342 coconuts and needs 3 coconuts for 1 crab, he can trade the 342 coconuts for 342/3 = 114 crabs. Then, he can trade the 114 crabs for 114/6 = 19 goats. Therefore, Max will have 19 goats after converting all 342 coconuts into goats. Answer: \\boxed{19}."}
