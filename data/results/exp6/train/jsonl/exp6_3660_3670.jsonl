How old is the dog?\n\nThe rabbit is half the age of the cat, so the rabbit is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 years old.\nThe dog is three times as old as the rabbit, so the dog is 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 years old. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jordan's dog, Max, was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old.  Luka is exactly 2 years older than is Aubrey.  On Aubrey's 8th birthday, how many years old was Jordan's dog, Max?\n", "text": "Jordan's dog, Max, was born on the same day that Luka turned 4 years old. Since Luka is exactly 2 years older than Aubrey, this means Luka is 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 years old. On Aubrey's 8th birthday, she is 8 years old. Therefore, since Max was born on the same day as Luka's 4th birthday, Max is 6 years old on Aubrey's 8th birthday. Answer: \\boxed{6}."}
