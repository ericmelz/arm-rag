The busiest month is April and May, and the slowest month is March. Thus, Dr. Banks gives out 82 - 46 = 36 more in the busiest month than the slowest month. Answer: \\boxed{36}."}

If there were $15 left in the cookie jar, how much money, in dollars, was there in the cookie jar at first?\n", "text": "Let's use the variable $x to represent the amount of money in the cookie jar at first.\n\nDoris spent $6 from the cookie jar, so there was $x - $6 left.\nMartha spent half as much as Doris, so she spent 1/2 * $6 = $3.\nTherefore, there was $x - $6 - $3 = $x - $9 left in the cookie jar after Martha's purchase.\n\nGiven that there were $15 left in the cookie jar, we can set up the following equation: $x - $9 = $15.\nNow, let's solve for $x.\n\n$x - $9 = $15\nTo isolate the variable, we can add $9 to both sides of the equation.\n\n$x = $15 + $9\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n$x = $24\n\nTherefore, there was $24 in the cookie jar at first.

How many bones did she start with before eating them on Saturday?\n\nLet's say Lassie started with x bones.\nAfter eating half of them on Saturday, she remained with x/2 bones.\nOn Sunday, she received 10 more bones, so her total number of bones increased to x/2 + 10.\nWe are told that she now has a total of 35 bones, so x/2 + 10 = 35.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get x/2 = 25.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we have x = 2 * 25 = <<2*25=50>>50.\nTherefore, Lassie started with 50 bones before eating half of them on Saturday.

If each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread, how many pieces of bread does Sally eat across Saturday and Sunday?\n\nAcross Saturday and Sunday, Sally eats 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 sandwiches.\nThus, she eats 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 pieces of bread.

If each rawhide bone is $1, and each dog biscuit is $0.25, then how much does it cost, in dollars, to feed Belle these treats for a week?\n\nFirst find the total cost of the rawhide bones Belle eats each evening: $1/bone * 2 bones = $<<1*2=2>>2\nThen find the total cost of the dog biscuits Belle eats each evening: $0.25/biscuit * 4 biscuits = $<<0.25*4=1>>1\nThen find the total cost of the rawhide bones Belle eats each week: $2/day * 7 days/week = $<<2*7=14>>14\nThen find the total cost of the biscuits Belle eats each week: $1/day * 7 days/week = $<<1*7=7>>7\nThen add the cost of the biscuits and rawhide bones to find the total cost: $7 + $14 = $<<7+14=21>>21.
