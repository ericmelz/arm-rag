Mary has three bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. How many times does Mary need to charge her vacuum cleaner to vacuum her whole house?\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many minutes it takes Mary to vacuum her entire house. Each room takes her 4 minutes and she has 3 bedrooms + 1 kitchen + 1 living room = <<3+1+1=5>>5 rooms.\nThus, it takes 4 minutes/room * 5 rooms = <<4*5=20>>20 minutes to vacuum her whole house.\nNext, we need to find out how many times Mary needs to charge her vacuum cleaner. Since it lasts for 10 minutes per charge, she needs to charge it 20 minutes / 10 minutes/charge = <<20/10=2>>2 times to vacuum her whole house.

The loan shark charges Jerry 10% interest compounded monthly. (This means that every month the loan shark adds Jerry's interest amount to his loan, and the next month Jerry has to pay 10% on the new total). If Jerry doesn't make any payments, how much (in dollars) does the loan shark charge in interest the second month?\n\nTo calculate the interest charged the second month, we need to find 10% of Jerry's initial loan of $200 first, which is 0.10 * $200 = $<<0.10*200=20>>20.\nSince the interest is compounded monthly, we then add this interest amount to Jerry's loan, giving us a new total of $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=220>>220.\nTo find the interest charged the second month, we calculate 10% of $220, which is 0.10 * $220 = $<<0.10*220=22>>22.

If Jerry doesn't make any payments, how much (in dollars) does the loan shark charge in interest the second month?\n\nTo find the interest the loan shark charges the second month, we need to find 10% of the new total. \n\nThe new total after one month is $200 + $200*10% = $<<200+200*10*.01=220>>220.\n\nSo the loan shark charges $220*10% = $<<220*10*.01=22>>22 in interest.

If George plans to borrow for 2 weeks, how much in fees will he have to pay?\n\nThe finance fee for the first week is 5% of $100, or $100 * 0.05 = $<<100*0.05=5>>5.\nThe finance fee for the second week is twice the fee for the first week, or $5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThe total fee George will have to pay is $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.
