Answer: \\boxed{690}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tony puts $1,000 in a savings account for 1 year. It earns 20% interest. He then takes out half the money to buy a new TV. The next year, the remaining money earns 15% interest. How much is now in the account?\n\nThe savings account earns $1000 * 20% = $<<1000*20*.01=200>>200 the first year.\nSo, Tony has $1000 + $200 = $<<1000+200=1200>>1200 left in the savings account.\nHe takes out half of it which is $1200/2 = $<<1200/2=600>>600.\nSo, he left with $1200 - $600 = $<<1200-600=600>>600.\nThus, the savings account earns $600 * 15% = $<<600*15*.01=90>>90 the next year.\nTherefore, there is $600 + $90 = $<<600+90=690>>690 now in the account.
