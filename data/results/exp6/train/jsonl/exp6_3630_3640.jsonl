Jeremy then gifted Fred an additional 37 goats. If exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, how many male animals are there in the barn?\n\nInitially, Fred had a total of 100 horses + 29 sheep + 9 chickens = <<100+29+9=138>>138 animals in the barn.\nBrian bought half of the animals, so he bought 1/2 * 138 animals = <<1/2*138=69>>69 animals.\nAfter Brian bought half of the animals, there were 138 animals - 69 animals = <<138-69=69>>69 animals left in the barn.\nJeremy gifted an additional 37 goats, so the number of animals in the barn increased to 69 animals + 37 goats = <<69+37=106>>106 animals.\nIf exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, then the number of male animals is 106 animals/2 = <<106/2=53>>53 animals.

The landlord said that she needed to be able to pay 2 months' rent in advance to rent the place and she would also need to put down a deposit of $500.  How much more money did Janet need in order to rent the apartment?\n\nTwo months' rent would be 2*$1,250=$<<2*1250=2500>>2500.\nSo, in addition to first month's rent, Janet would need to pay 2*$1,250=$<<2*1250=2500>>2500.\nThis means that in addition to the $500 deposit, she would need to pay a total of $2,500+$500=$<<2500+500=3000>>3,000.\nThus, Janet needed $3,000-$2,225=$<<3000-2225=775>>775 more.
