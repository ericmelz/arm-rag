One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?\n\nThree machines, working 23 hours a day, produce a total of 3 machines * 23 hours/machine = <<3*23=69>>69 hours.\nSo before buying a new machine, the factory produces 69 hours * 2 kg/hour = <<69*2=138>>138 kg of material in total.\nEventually, after buying a fourth machine, the factory produces 69 hours + 12 hours = <<69+12=81>>81 hours.\nSo every day the factory produces 81 hours * 2 kg/hour = <<81*2=162>>162 kg of material.\nThis factory can earn 162 kg * $50/kg = $<<162*50=8100>>8100 in one day.

How much can this factory earn in one day?\n\nThe three machines working 23 hours a day can produce 3 machines * 23 hours/machine = <<3*23=69>>69 hours of work per day.\nSo producing material will take 69 hours * 2 kg/hour = <<69*2=138>>138 kg of material every day.\nThe four machines working 23 hours a day will produce 138 kg + 1 machine * 12 hours/day * 2 kg/hour = <<138+1*12*2=162>>162 kg of material every day.\nSo the factory will earn 162 kg * $50/kg = $<<162*50=8100>>8100 every day.

One machine can produce 2 kg of material every hour. The factory sells the produced material for $50 per 1 kg. How much can this factory earn in one day?\n\nIn one day, each machine produces 2 kg/hour * 23 hours/day = <<2*23=46>>46 kg material.\nSo the total weight of material produced per day is 46 kg/day/machine * 3 machines = <<46*3=138>>138 kg/day.\nThe fourth machine produces 2 kg/hour * 12 hours/day = <<2*12=24>>24 kg material per day.\nSo the total weight of material produced per day is 138 kg/day + 24 kg/day = <<138+24=162>>162 kg/day.\nTherefore, the factory can earn 162 kg/day * $50/kg = $<<162*50=8100>>8100 in one day.

If they reduced the total production by 10 percent in the second year, calculate the total production of television by the factory in the second year.\n\nIn the first year, the factory produced 10 televisions per day, and since a year has 365 days, the total production in the first year is 10*365 = <<10*365=3650>>3650 televisions\nIf they reduced the production by 10 percent in the second year, they produced 10*10/100 = <<10*10/100=1>>1 fewer television every day.\nThe total number of televisions produced per day in the second year is 10-1 = <<10-1=9>>9 televisions.\nSince a year has 365 days, the total production of TVs in the second year is 9*365 = <<9*365=3285>>3285 television.

How many cents can you save on each apple from buying $4 for 10 apples than from $3 for 6 apples?\n\nIn the first store, you would pay $3 for 6 apples, so each apple costs $3/6 = $<<3/6=0.5>>0.5.\nIn the second store, you would pay $4 for 10 apples, so each apple costs $4/10 = $<<4/10=0.4>>0.4.\nTherefore, you can save $0.5 - $0.4 = $<<0.5-0.4=0.1>>0.1 on each apple by buying $4 for 10 apples instead of $3 for 6 apples.\nSince there are 100 cents in each dollar, you can save 0.1 * 100 = <<0.1*100=10>>10 cents on each apple.

How many cents can you save on each apple from buying $4 for 10 apples than from $3 for 6 apples?\n\nThe price per apple in the first store is $3/6 = $<<3/6=0.5>>0.5.\nThe price per apple in the second store is $4/10 = $<<4/10=0.4>>0.4.\nTherefore, you can save $0.5 - $0.4 = $<<0.5-0.4=0.1>>0.1 on each apple.\nSince $1 = 100 cents, then $0.1 = 100 * 0.1 = <<100*0.1=10>>10 cents.\nTherefore, you can save 10 cents on each apple from buying $4 for 10 apples than from $3 for 6 apples.

How many cents can you save on each apple from buying $4 for 10 apples than from $3 for 6 apples?\n\nIn the first store, each apple costs $3/6 = $<<3/6=0.50>>0.50\nIn the second store, each apple costs $4/10 = $<<4/10=0.40>>0.40\nTherefore, you can save $0.50 - $0.40 = $<<0.50-0.40=0.10>>0.10 on each apple when you buy $4 for 10 apples than from $3 for 6 apples.\nSince 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, then you can save $0.10 x 100 cents/$1 = <<0.10*100=10>>10 cents on each apple.
