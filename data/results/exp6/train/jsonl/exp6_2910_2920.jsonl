If Bob is 11 years old, and Susan is 15 years old, how old are all four family members in total?\n\nSince Arthur is 2 years older than Susan, he is 15 + 2 = <<15+2=17>>17 years old\nTom is 3 years younger than Bob, so Tom is 11 - 3 = <<11-3=8>>8 years old\nAdding up the age of all four family members gives 11 + 15 + 17 + 8 = <<11+15+17+8=51>>51 years. Answer: \\boxed{51}.\n\n\nQuestion: Adam and Tom are brothers. Adam is 8 years old and Tom is 12 years old. In how many years will their combined age be 44 years old?\n", "text": "Currently, Adam and Tom's combined age is 8 + 12 = <<8+12=20>>20 years old.\nLet's suppose X is the number of years they need for their combined age to be 44 years old.\nAfter X years, Adam will be 8+X years old, and Tom will be 12+X years old.\nSo, their combined age after X years will be (8+X) + (12+X) = 20 + 2X years.\nWe can set up an equation to solve for X:\n20 + 2X = 44\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get:\n2X = 24\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nX = 12\nTherefore, it will take 12 years for their combined age to be 44 years old.
