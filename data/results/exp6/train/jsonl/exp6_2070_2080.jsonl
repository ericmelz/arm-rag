How many times faster than the first popsicle does the last popsicle\u2019s remains melt?\n\nLet's say the melting rate of the first popsicle is x.\nThen the melting rate of the second popsicle is 2x (twice as fast).\nThe melting rate of the third popsicle is 2*2x = 4x (twice as fast as the second popsicle).\nSimilarly, the melting rate of the fourth popsicle is 2*4x = 8x (twice as fast as the third popsicle).\nThe melting rate of the fifth popsicle is 2*8x = 16x (twice as fast as the fourth popsicle).\nFinally, the melting rate of the last popsicle is 2*16x = 32x (twice as fast as the fifth popsicle).\nTherefore, the last popsicle's remains melt 32 times faster than the first popsicle's remains.
