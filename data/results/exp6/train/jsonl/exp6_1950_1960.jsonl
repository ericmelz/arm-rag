If they both took a total of 70 minutes to run the race, calculate the total number of minutes that Rickey took to finish the race.\n\nLet's say Rickey took x minutes to finish the race.\nPrejean's time to finish the race was 3/4*x = (3/4)*x minutes.\nTogether, they took (3/4)*x + x = 70 minutes to finish the race.\nCombining like terms, we get (3/4 + 1)*x = (7/4)*x = 70.\nMultiplying both sides by (4/7), we get x = 70*(4/7) = <<70*(4/7)=40>>40\nRickey took x = 40 minutes to finish the race.

If they both took a total of 70 minutes to run the race, calculate the total number of minutes that Rickey took to finish the race.\n\nLet's say Rickey took X minutes to finish the race.\nSince Prejean's speed in the race was three-quarters that of Rickey, Prejean took 3/4*X = (3/4)X minutes.\nTogether, they took X+(3/4)X = 70 minutes to run the race.\nThe total time they took is X+(3/4)X = 1*X+(3/4)*X = (7/4)*X=70\nThe time Rickey took to finish the race is X = 4/7*(7/4)*X = (4/7)*70 = <<4/7*70=40>>40 minutes.

If they both took a total of 70 minutes to run the race, calculate the total number of minutes that Rickey took to finish the race.\n\nLet's say Rickey took x minutes to finish the race.\nIf Prejean's speed in the race was three quarters Rickey's speed, she took three quarters*x = 3/4*x  minutes to finish the race.\nTogether, Rickey and Prejean took x+3/4*x = 70 minutes to finish the race.\nCombining like terms, we get 7/4*x = 70\nMultiplying both sides by 4/7, we get x = (4*70)/7 = <<4*70)/7=40>>40 minutes.

If they both took a total of 70 minutes to run the race, calculate the total number of minutes that Rickey took to finish the race.\n\nLet's say Rickey took T minutes to finish the race.\nIf Prejean's speed in the race was three-quarters that of Rickey, he took 3/4*T = 3T/4 minutes to finish the race.\nThe total time both took to run the race is T+3T/4 = 70\nMultiplying 4 throughout the equation gives 4*(T+3T/4) = 70*4\nCombining like terms gives 4T+3T= 280\nAdding like terms give 7T=280\nDividing both sides by 7 gives T = 280/7\nThe total number of minutes that Rickey took to finish the race is T = <<280/7=40>>40.

If Amy is twice as fast as Manu, how long did it take her to finish the race?\n\nSince Manu took 12 seconds longer than Patrick to finish the race, he took 12+ 60 = <<12+60=72>>72 seconds to complete the race.\nSince Amy is twice as fast as Manu, it took her 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>36 seconds to complete the race.
