How many liters of water are contained in 2 buckets?\n\nSince a jug contains 5 liters of water, then 4 jugs contain 4 x 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 liters of water.\nThus, 2 buckets contain 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 liters of water.

He sells ducks for $10 and chickens for $8. He sells 5 chickens and some ducks. He then spends half his earnings on a new wheelbarrow. After buying it, someone sees it and agrees to pay the farmer double what the farmer paid and the farmer earns another $60. How many ducks did the farmer sell?\n\nLet's assume the farmer sold x ducks.\nThe earnings from selling chickens is 5 * $8 = $<<5*8=40>>40.\nThe earnings from selling ducks is x * $10 = $10x.\nThe total earnings are $40 + $10x.\nThe farmer spends half his total earnings ($40 + $10x)/2 = $20 + $5x on the wheelbarrow.\nSo without the earnings from selling the wheelbarrow, he earns another $60, which means double what he spent on the wheelbarrow.\nThat means the wheelbarrow cost him $60 / 2 = $<<60/2=30>>30.\nSo, $20 + $5x = $30.\nTherefore, $5x = $30 - $20 = $10.\nSo x = $10 / $5 = 2.\nThe farmer sold 2 ducks at the market.
