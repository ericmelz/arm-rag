If he pays each employee $12.50 an hour, what are his weekly expenses to run the store?\n\nThe store is open 16 hours a day for 5 days so he is open 16*5 = <<16*5=80>>80 hours a week\nHe pays each of his 2 employees $12.50 an hour and they work a total of 80 hours so he pays out 2*12.50*80 = $<<2*12.5*80=2000.00>>2,000 in employee wages\nRent is $1,200 and an additional 20% goes to pay for utilities so that\u2019s an extra 1200*.20 = $<<1200*.20=240.00>>240\nEmployee wages are $2,000 and rent/utilities total $1,200 plus another $240 so his total costs are 2000+1200+240 = $<<2000+1200+240=3440.00>>3,440.00.

He needs to pay rent of $1200 a week with an additional 20% of rent to pay for utilities and he has 2 employees per shift with the store open 16 hours a day for 5 days a week.  If he pays each employee $12.50 an hour, what are his weekly expenses to run the store?\n\nFirst we need to determine how many hours a week the store is open by multiplying the 16 hours the store is open per day * 5 days a week = <<16*5=80>>80 hours a week\nWe need to multiply the number of hours a store is open by the number of employees per shift to determine how many employee hours are worked in a week, 80 hours a week * 2 employees per shift = <<80*2=160>>160 employee hours per week\nTo determine how much he pays in salary, we then take the number of employee hours worked * the hourly rate, 160 * 12.5 = $<<160*12.5=2000>>2000 in salaries per week\nTo find out how much his utilities are, we first have to take the cost of rent and multiply it by 20% since utilities cost 20% of the weekly rent, 1200*.2 = $<<1200*.2=240>>240 per week\nWe then add up all of his costs, the salaries are 2000, his utilities are 240 so his total expenses are 1200+2000+240 = $<<1200+2000+240=3440>>3,440 per week.
