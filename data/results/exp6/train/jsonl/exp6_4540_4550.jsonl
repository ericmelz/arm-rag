Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: John climbs up 9 flights of stairs.  Each flight is 10 feet.  If each step is 18 inches, how many steps does he climb up?\n\nHe travels 9*10= <<9*10=90>>90 feet\nSo he uses 90/1.5=<<90/1.5=60>>60 steps. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: Every Sunday John is allowed to watch cartoons. However, for every 10 minutes of cartoons, he has to do 8 minutes of chores. If he watches cartoons for 2 hours, how many minutes of chores does he have to do?\n\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 2 hours are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nIf for every 10 minutes of cartoons John has to do 8 minutes of chores, then he has to do 120/10*8 = <<120/10*8=96>>96 minutes of chores. Answer: \\boxed{96}.\n\n\nQuestion: Every Sunday John is allowed to watch cartoons. However, for every 10 minutes of cartoons, he has to do 8 minutes of chores. If he watches cartoons for 2 hours, how many minutes of chores does he have to do?\n\nIn 2 hours, there are 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nFor every 10 minutes of cartoons, John has to do 8 minutes of chores.\nThus, if he watches cartoons for 120 minutes, he has to do 120 / 10 * 8 = <<120/10*8=96>>96 minutes of chores. Answer: \\boxed{96}.\n\n\nQuestion: John can read a book 60% faster than his brother.  If his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, how long would it take John to read 3 books?\n", "text": "John can read a book 60% faster than his brother, which means he can read a book 100% + 60% = 160% as fast as his brother.\nIf his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, John can read a book in 8 hours/book * (100%/160%) = 5 hours/book.\nIf John can read a book in 5 hours, it would take him 5 hours/book * 3 books = <<5*3=15>>15 hours to read 3 books.
