If she got $50 in gift cards, how many students were in her class?\n\nLet the total students in her class be x.\nFrom the problem, Ms. Jones got thank you cards from 30% of her class, which is 30% * x = 30x/100 = 3x/10\nOut of the thank you cards, 1/3 of them contained a gift card. Therefore, 1/3 * 3x/10 = x/10 of cards contained a gift card.\nAccording to the problem, x/10 of cards contained a $10 gift card. Therefore, x*(10*(1/10)) = $10x/10 = x.\nSince 1/3 of the thank you cards contained a gift card and it amounted to $50, x has to hold the same monetary value. Therefore, x = $50.
