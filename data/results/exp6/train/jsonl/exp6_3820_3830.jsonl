During the first week, people in Daniel's neighborhood pile the extra garbage around the dumpster, during the second week they apply a policy of cutting their amount of garbage in half. How many kilograms of garbage have accumulated in Daniel's neighborhood during the 2 weeks?\n\nDuring the first week, the neighborhood piles an extra 200 kg of garbage per garbage collection day, so during the first week of not picking up the garbage truck's garbage it has accumulated 200 kg/day * 3 days = <<200*3=600>>600 kg of garbage.\nThe second week, where garbage is reduced by 50% compared to usual is the same as saying only 100% - 50% = 50% of usual trash per garbage collection day is amassed.\nSo it accumulates 200 kg/day * 50% = <<200*50*.01=100>>100 kg of garbage per each of the three days.\nSo during the second week, it accumulates 100 kg/day * 3 days = <<100*3=300>>300 kg of garbage in total.\nThere's a total of 600 kg from week 1 and 300 kg from week 2 so 600 kg + 300 kg = <<600+300=900>>900 kg of garbage have accumulated.

Every Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday. If each yard of fabric costs $2 and each yard of yarn costs $3, how much does he earn from Monday to Wednesday?\n\nEvery Monday Daniel earns 20 x $2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nEvery Tuesday he delivers 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 yards of fabric.\nSo every Tuesday he earns 40 x $2 = $<<40*2=80>>80.\nEvery Wednesday he delivers 40/4 = <<40/4=10>>10 yards of fabric.\nSo every Wednesday he earns 10 x $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nTherefore, he earns $40 + $80 + $20 = $<<40+80+20=140>>140 from Monday to Wednesday.

Together, they consume a total of 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 people every week.\nIf there are initially 72 people in the village, the number of weeks the village will last both of them is 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 weeks.

If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nLet's start by finding out how many women are at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 guests is (40/100)*200 = <<(40/100)*200=80>>80 women.\nOut of the 80 women, 80% are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 women is (80/100)*80 = <<(80/100)*80=64>>64 women.\nNow let's find out how many men are at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200 and that 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 men.\nOut of the 120 men, 60% are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 men is (60/100)*120 = <<(60/100)*120=72>>72 men.\nThe total number of people wearing rabbit ears is 64 women + 72 men = <<64+72=136>>136 people. Answer: \\boxed{136}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a James Bond movie party, each guest is either male (M) or female (F. 40% of the guests are women, 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears, and 60% of the males are wearing rabbit ears. If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of women at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 is (40/100)*200 = <<40/100*200=80>>80.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of women wearing rabbit ears. We know that 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 is (80/100)*80 = <<80/100*80=64>>64.\nThen, we need to calculate the number of men at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200, and 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of men wearing rabbit ears. We know that 60% of the men are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 is (60/100)*120 = <<60/100*120=72>>72.\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of people wearing rabbit ears by adding the number of women wearing rabbit ears (64) and the number of men wearing rabbit ears (72), which is 64 + 72 = <<64+72=136>>136. Answer: \\boxed{136}.\n\n\nQuestion: A movie that's 1.5 hours long is being replayed 6 times in one movie theater each day. There is a 20-minute advertisement before the start of the movie. How long, in hours, does the movie theater operate each day?\n\nThe movie runs for 1.5 hours per screening, so in total, it runs for 1.5 * 6 = <<1.5*6=9>>9 hours.\nThe advertisements run for 20 minutes before each screening, so in total, they run for 20 * 6 = <<20*6=120>>120 minutes.\nConverting 120 minutes to hours, we have 120 / 60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours.\nThus, the movie theater operates for 9 + 2 = <<9+2=11>>11 hours a day. Answer: \\boxed{11}.\n\n\nQuestion: There were a total of 50 guests in a movie screening of which half of the guests are women, 15 are men, and the rest are children. In the middle of the movie, 1/5 of the men and 4 children left. How many people stayed?\n", "text": "Out of the total 50 guests, half of them are women which is 50/2 = 25.\nSo, 25+15 = 40 of the 50 guests are either women or men.\nSo, there were 50-40 = 10 children in the movie screening.\nThen 1/5 x 15 = 3 men left in the middle of the movie.\nAnd 4 children also left so only 3+4 = 7 people left.\nTherefore, 50-7 = 43 people stayed. Answer: \\boxed{43}."}
