If Erin watches all of the episodes in one sitting, one after the other with no breaks, how many hours will she spend watching the series?\n", "text": "If Erin watches all 6 episodes, with each episode lasting for 50 minutes, then the total duration of the series is 6 * 50 = <<6*50=300>>300 minutes.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, Erin will spend a total of 300 / 60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours watching the entire series. Answer: \\boxed{5}."}
