When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalled the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone.

The next lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalled the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. How long is that?\n\nFirst find the length of time the second lock stalls the raccoons at by multiplying the length of time the first lock stalls the raccoons by 3: 5 minutes * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 minutes\nThen subtract 3 minutes from that amount to find how long the second lock stalls the racocons for: 15 minutes - 3 minutes = <<15-3=12>>12 minutes\nThen multiply that amount by 5 to find how long the two locks hold the raccoons off for: 5 * 12 minutes = <<5*12=60>>60 minutes.

During her hike, she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour and eats 1/3rd the weight of food per hour as water per hour. How much weight is she carrying after six hours?\n\nKaren's water lasts her 10 hours because 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10\nKaren's food lasts for 30 hours because 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30\nAfter 6 hours, Karen has drunk 12 pounds of water because 2 x 6 = <<2*6=12>>12\nAfter 6 hours, Karen has eaten 4 pounds of food because 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4\nKaren's pack weight is now 34 pounds because 20 + 10 + 20 - 12 - 4 = <<20+10+20-12-4=34>>34.

Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Cynthia has three children whose ages add up to 35. Matthew is two years older than Rebecca and four years younger than Freddy. How many years old is Freddy?\n\nLet's denote Rebecca's age as x.\nMatthew is 2 years older than Rebecca, so Matthew's age is x + 2.\nMatthew is also 4 years younger than Freddy, so Freddy's age is x + 2 + 4 = x + 6.\nThe sum of their ages is x + x + 2 + x + 6 = 35.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x + 8 = 35.\nSubtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 27.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 9.\nTherefore, Freddy's age is 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 years old.

How many years old is Freddy?\n\nLet's represent the ages of the three children as follows: Matthew = M, Rebecca = R, Freddy = F.\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following equations:\nM + R + F = 35 (The ages of the three children add up to 35)\nM = R + 2 (Matthew is two years older than Rebecca)\nM = F - 4 (Matthew is four years younger than Freddy)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two:\nR = 35 - M - F\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we get:\nM = (35 - M - F) + 2\n2M = 37 - F\n\nFrom the third equation, we can express one of the variables in terms of the another:\nF = M + 4\n\nSubstituting into the previous equation, we get:\n2M = 37 - (M + 4)\n2M = 33 - M\n3M = 33\nM = 11\n\nSubstituting the obtained value of M into the third equation, we get:\nF = 11 + 4\nF = 15\n\nTherefore, Freddy is 15 years old.
