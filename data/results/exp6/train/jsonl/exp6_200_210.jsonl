If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?\n\nLet's assume that there were \"x\" lions in Londolozi at first.\nAfter 12 months, the number of lion cubs born is 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60\nDuring the same period, the number of lions that died is 1 * 12 = <<1*12=12>>12\nTherefore, the total number of lions after 1 year is x + 60 - 12 = <<x+60-12=x+48>>x+48\nGiven that the total number of lions after one year is 148, then x+48 = 148.\nSo the initial number of lions at Londolozi is x = 148 - 48 = <<148-48=100>>100. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are some lions in Londolozi at first. Lion cubs are born at the rate of 5 per month and lions die at the rate of 1 per month. If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?\n\nLet's assume that there were x lions in Londolozi at first.\nAfter 1 month, the number of lions will be x + 5 - 1 = x + 4\nAfter 2 months, the number of lions will be (x + 4) + 5 - 1 = x + 8\nAfter 3 months, the number of lions will be (x + 8) + 5 - 1 = x + 12\nAfter n months, the number of lions will be x + 4n\nAfter 1 year (12 months), the number of lions will be x + 4 * 12 = x + 48\nSince there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, x + 48 = 148\nSubtracting 48 from both sides of the equation, x = 148 - 48 = 100\nTherefore, there were 100 lions in Londolozi at first. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 100 lions in Londolozi at first. If lion cubs are born at the rate of 5 per month and lions die at the rate of 1 per month, how many lions will there be in Londolozi after 1 year?\n\nIn a month, the number of lion cubs born is 5, so after 12 months, the number of cubs born is 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60.\nIn a month, the number of lions that die is 1, so after 12 months, the number of lions that die is 1 * 12 = <<1*12=12>>12.\nThe total number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year will be 100 + 60 - 12 = <<100+60-12=148>>148 lions.
