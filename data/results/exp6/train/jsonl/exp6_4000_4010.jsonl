How much further did Mark's bottle cap go than Jenny's?\n\nJenny's bottlecap flies 18 feet + 18 feet / 3 = <<18+18/3=24>>24 feet.\nMark's bottlecap flies 15 feet + 15 x 2 = <<15+15*2=45>>45 feet.\nThus, Mark's bottlecap went 45 feet - 24 feet = <<45-24=21>>21 feet further than Jenny's.

Jenny's bottlecap flies 18 feet straight, then bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went. Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did. How much further did Mark's bottle cap go than Jenny's?\n\nFirst find how far Jenny's bottle cap went after bouncing: 1/3 * 18 feet = <<1/3*18=6>>6 feet\nThen add that distance to the distance it traveled before bouncing to find the total distance: 6 feet + 18 feet = <<6+18=24>>24 feet\nThen use the same process to find the total distance Mark's bottle cap traveled before and after bouncing: 15 feet + 2 * 15 feet = <<15+2*15=45>>45 feet\nThen subtract the distance Jenny's bottle cap traveled from the distance Mark's traveled to find the difference: 45 feet - 24 feet = <<45-24=21>>21 feet.
