If the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime in his till, plus a bunch of nickels, how many nickels does Mark get in his change?\n\nMark spends $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25 in total.\nHe hands over $7.00, so he receives $7.00 - $6.25 = $<<7-6.25=0.75>>0.75 in change.\nHe receives 1 quarter worth $0.25 and 1 dime worth $0.10 so his change comes to $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35.\nThis means that Mark must receive $0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40 worth of nickels.\nSince each nickel is worth $0.05, this means that Mark receives $0.40 / $0.05 = <<0.4/0.05=8>>8 nickels.

If he counted 312 cars total, how many of them were purple?\n\nLet p be the number of purple cars\nThe number of red cars is p+6\nAnd the number of green cars is 4(p+6)=4p+24\nThere are p+(p+6)+(4p+24)=312 cars total.\nCombining like terms, we get 6p+30=312\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 6p=282\nDividing both sides by 6, we get p=<<47=47>>47 purple cars.

While she is waiting for school to start on Monday she counts the tiles on the ceiling--38. While she is waiting for everyone to finish their tests after she has handed in hers, she counts the books in the room--75. On Tuesday Carla counts all the tiles twice in a row and she counts the books three times in a row when she has to wait for a long time for the teacher to finish handing out the graded tests. If every time Carla counts something counts as once, how many times has Carla counted something on Tuesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, Carla counts the tiles twice in a row, and the books three times in a row. So, she has counted the tiles 2 * 38 = <<2*38=76>>76 times.\nAnd she has counted the books 3 * 75 = <<3*75=225>>225 times.\nIn total, Carla has counted something 76 + 225 = <<76+225=301>>301 times on Tuesday.

After they were done eating the waitress gave a $30 bill to Bob and a $25 bill to Kate, but told them they were eligible for special discounts; 5% for Bob, 2% for Kate. Considering the discounts, how much do they have to pay in total?\n", "text": "Bob gets a discount of 5%, which is equal to $30 * 0.05 = $1.50. \nSo, Bob has to pay $30 - $1.50 = $28.50. \nKate gets a discount of 2%, which is equal to $25 * 0.02 = $0.50. \nSo, Kate has to pay $25 - $0.50 = $24.50. \nIn total, Bob and Kate have to pay $28.50 + $24.50 = $53.
