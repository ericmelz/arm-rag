How much longer must the cell phone be charged to reach 100% charge?\n\nSince the phone has reached 25% charge after charging for 45 minutes, this means that 1% of the charge was achieved every 45/25 = <<45/25=1.8>>1.8 minutes.\nTo reach 100% charge, the phone still needs to be charged for an additional 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75%.\nThis means that it needs to be charged for an additional 75 x 1.8 = <<75*1.8=135>>135 minutes.

How much longer must the cell phone be charged to reach 100% charge?\n\nIf 45 minutes of charging brought the cell phone to a 25% charge, then each 1% of charge takes 45/25 = <<45/25=1.8>>1.8 minutes.\nTo reach 100% charge, the cell phone must be charged for an additional 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75%.\nThis will take an additional 75 * 1.8 = <<75*1.8=135>>135 minutes.

How much longer must the cell phone be charged to reach 100% charge?\n\nIf 45 minutes of charging brought the cell phone to a 25% charge, then each 25% takes 45 minutes to charge. To reach 100%, the cell phone must charge 3 times more, so it needs to be charged for 3 * 45 minutes = <<3*45=135>>135 more minutes. Answer: \\boxed{135}.\n\n\nQuestion: Nicky went to the DMV. He spent 20 minutes waiting to take a number, and quadruple that amount of time plus 14 minutes waiting for his number to be called. How long did he wait total?\n\nNicky spent 20 minutes x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 minutes waiting for his number to be called.\nSo, the total time he waited is 80 minutes + 14 minutes + 20 minutes = <<80+14+20=114>>114 minutes.
