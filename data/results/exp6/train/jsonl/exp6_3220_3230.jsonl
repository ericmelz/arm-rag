It takes two visits, though, instead of 1.   A normal doctor charges $200 for a visit.   How much money does he save?\n\nThe discount clinic charges 200*.7=$<<200*.7=140>>140 less than a normal visit.\nThus, he pays 200-140=$<<200-140=60>>60 per visit.\nSince he goes twice, he pays 60*2=$<<60*2=120>>120.\nThus, he saves 200-120=$<<200-120=80>>80.

If insurance covered 60% how much was Tom's out-of-pocket cost?\n\nThe insurance covered 300+200=$<<300+200=500>>500 to start\nThat means Tom had to pay 500*.4=$<<500*.4=200>>200 out of pocket.

How much money does he have left to finish the month?\n\nTom spends 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 dollars in the first week.\nHe has 12 \u2013 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 dollars left.\nThen he spends 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 dollars in the second week.\nHe has 8 \u2013 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 dollars left to finish the month. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom's cat needs an expensive surgery.  He has had pet insurance for 24 months that cost $20 per month.  The procedure cost $5000 but the insurance covers all but 20% of this.  How much money did he save by having insurance?\n\nHe paid for insurance for 24 months at a cost of $20 per month so he paid 24*20 = $<<24*20=480>>480\nThe surgery cost $5000 and insurance covered 80% of it so that's .80*5000 = $<<5000*.80=4000>>4000 for insurance to cover\nThe surgery cost $5000, insurance covered $4000 of it so he had to pay 5000-4000 = $<<5000-4000=1000>>1000 out of pocket\nHe paid $480 for insurance over 2 years and the surgery cost $1000 so all total he paid 480+1000 = $<<480+1000=1480>>1,480\nWithout insurance the surgery would have cost $5000, with insurance it cost him 1480 so he saved 5000-1480 = $<<5000-1480=3520>>3,520.

A normal doctor charges $200 for a visit.   How much money does he save?\n\nThe discount clinic charges 200(.70) = $<<200*.70=140>>140 less per visit\nThat means each visit to the discount clinic cost 200-140 = $<<200-140=60>>60\nThat means he paid 60*2 = $<<60*2=120>>120\nHe saved 200-120 = $<<200-120=80>>80.

He needs to go to the doctor every 6 months to get a new prescription and a visit to the doctor costs $400.  The medication costs $5 per pill, but insurance covers 80% of that cost.  How much does he pay a year for everything?\n", "text": "Tom needs to go to the doctor twice a year, so that costs 2*$400 = $800 per year\nEach pill costs $5, and insurance covers 80% of that cost, so he pays 20%*$5 = $1 per pill\nHe takes 2 pills per day, so that's 2*$1 = $2 per day\nHe takes medication every day, so that's $2 per day * 365 days = $730 per year\nIn total, he pays $800 for doctor visits + $730 for medication = $1530 per year.
