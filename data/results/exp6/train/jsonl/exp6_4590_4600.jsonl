There are 4 times as many test points as quiz points, and 5 more quiz points than homework points.  How many homework points are there in the first quarter?\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many points the homework and quiz are worth. We know that there are four times as many test points as quiz points, so there are 4 * x quiz points, where x is the number of quiz points.\nWe also know that there are 5 more quiz points than homework points, so there are x - 5 homework points.\nFinally, we know that the sum of homework points, quiz points, and test points equals 265: x - 5 + x + 4x = 265.\nCombining like terms, we get 6x - 5 = 265.\nAdding 5 to both sides, we get 6x = 270.\nDividing both sides by 6, we get x = 45.\nThus, there are x - 5 = 45 - 5 = <<45-5=40>>40 homework points in the first quarter.

How many grams does the salad dressing weigh?\n", "text": "To find the weight of the salad dressing, we need to calculate the weight of the oil and vinegar separately and then add them together.\n\nFirst, we find the volume of oil in the bowl. The bowl can hold 150 ml of liquid, and Mason fills 2/3 of it with oil. So the volume of oil is 150 ml * (2/3) = 100 ml.\n\nNext, we calculate the weight of the oil. The oil weighs 5 grams per ml, so the weight of 100 ml of oil is 100 ml * 5 g/ml = 500 grams.\n\nSimilarly, we find the volume of vinegar in the bowl. The bowl can hold 150 ml of liquid, and Mason fills 1/3 of it with vinegar. So the volume of vinegar is 150 ml * (1/3) = 50 ml.\n\nNext, we calculate the weight of the vinegar. The vinegar weighs 4 grams per ml, so the weight of 50 ml of vinegar is 50 ml * 4 g/ml = 200 grams.\n\nFinally, we add the weight of the oil and the weight of the vinegar to find the total weight of the salad dressing. 500 grams + 200 grams = 700 grams.\n\nTherefore, the salad dressing weighs 700 grams.
