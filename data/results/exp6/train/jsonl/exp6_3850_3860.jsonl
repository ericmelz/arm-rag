Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?\n\nTo find the total number of cases of soda needed for the pyramid, we need to sum up the number of cases on each level of the pyramid.\n\nLevel 1: The top level has only 1 case.\nLevel 2: The second level has a square base with sides that are 1 case longer than the top level, so it has 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 cases.\nLevel 3: The third level has a square base with sides that are 1 case longer than the second level, so it has 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 cases.\nLevel 4: The fourth level has a square base with sides that are 1 case longer than the third level, so it has 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 cases.\n\nTo find the total, we sum up the cases on each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = <<1+4+9+16=30>>30 cases.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build the pyramid.

Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?\n\nTo find the number of cases needed, we need to sum up the number of cases in each level of the pyramid. \n\nThe top level has just 1 case. \n\nThe next level has a base of 2 cases per side, so there are 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 cases in total in the second level. \n\nThe next level has a base of 3 cases per side, so there are 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 cases in total in the third level. \n\nThe final level has a base of 4 cases per side, so there are 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 cases in total in the fourth level. \n\nTherefore, Mark needs 1+4+9+16=<<1+4+9+16=30>>30 cases of soda.

Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?\n\nTo find the total number of soda cases needed, we need to sum up the number of cases in each level of the pyramid.\n\nThe first level, or the base of the pyramid, has a side length of 1 case. Therefore, it will require 1^2 = 1 case.\n\nThe second level, one case above the base, has a side length of 2 cases. It will require 2^2 = 4 cases.\n\nThe third level, two cases above the base, has a side length of 3 cases. It will require 3^2 = 9 cases.\n\nThe fourth level, three cases above the base, has a side length of 4 cases. It will require 4^2 = 16 cases.\n\nTo find the total number of cases needed, we add up the cases from each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = <<1+4+9+16=30>>30 cases.\n\nTherefore, Mark will need 30 cases of soda to build the pyramid.

How many oranges does he need to pick out to have 12 total pieces of fruit?\n\nMark has already selected 3 apples and 4 bananas, so he has 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 pieces of fruit.\nThus, he needs to pick out 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 oranges.

How many oranges does he need to pick out to have 12 total pieces of fruit?\n\nMark has already chosen 3 apples and a bunch of 4 bananas, meaning he has already selected 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 pieces of fruit.\nTo have a total of 12 pieces of fruit, Mark needs to choose 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 oranges.

Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?\n", "text": "To find the total number of soda cases needed, we can use the formula for the sum of squares. \n\nThe formula for the sum of squares is given by:\n\n1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 = (n(n+1)(2n+1))/6\n\nIn this case, n is the number of levels in the pyramid, which is 4.\n\nSubstituting n = 4 into the formula, we get:\n\n1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = (4(4+1)(2(4)+1))/6\n                          = (4(5)(9))/6\n                          = (180)/6\n                          = 30\n\nTherefore, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build the pyramid.
