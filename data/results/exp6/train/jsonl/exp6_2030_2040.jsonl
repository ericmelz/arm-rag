How many seconds does it take for the three of them to run the 600-meter relay race?\n\nIf Rhonda runs 200 meters in 24 seconds, then Sally, whose time is two seconds longer, runs the same distance in 24+2=<<24+2=26>>26 seconds.\nIf Diane runs 200 meters three seconds faster than Rhonda, then it takes her 24-3=<<24-3=21>>21 seconds to run that distance.\nIf Rhonda runs the first 200 meters, Sally runs the 2nd and Diane the third, then the total time to run the race is 24+26+21=<<24+26+21=71>>71 seconds. Answer: \\boxed{71}.\n\n\nQuestion: When Patrick, Manu, and Amy participate in a race they realize that Patrick finishes the race in 60 seconds. Manu took 12 more seconds to finish the race. If Amy is twice as fast as Manu, how long did it take her to finish the race?\n\nSince Manu took 12 seconds longer than Patrick to finish the race, he took 12+ 60 = <<12+60=72>>72 seconds to complete the race.\nSince Amy is twice as fast as Manu, it took her 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>36 seconds to complete the race.
