How many are not pine trees?\n", "text": "To find the number of trees that are not pine trees, we start with the total number of trees (350) and subtract the number of pine trees. The number of pine trees can be found by multiplying the total number of trees by the percentage of pine trees (70%). \n\n70% of 350 is calculated as 350 x 70/100 = 245. \n\nSo, the number of trees that are not pine trees is 350 - 245 = 105. \n\nTherefore, there are 105 trees that are not pine trees.
