Billy swims his first 5 laps in 2 minutes, swims the next 3 laps in 4 minutes, swims the next lap in 1 minute, then swims his final lap. Margaret finishes swimming all of her laps in 10 minutes. Billy wins the competition by finishing his laps 30 seconds before Margaret does. In seconds, how long did it take Billy to swim his final lap?\n\nBilly's total time swimming his first 5 laps is 2 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<2*60=120>>120 seconds.\nBilly's total time swimming his next 3 laps is 4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<4*60=240>>240 seconds.\nBilly's total time swimming his first 8 laps is 120 + 240 = <<120+240=360>>360 seconds.\nBilly's total time swimming his first 9 laps is 360 + 60 = <<360+60=420>>420 seconds.\nBilly's time is 10 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = <<10*60=600>>600 seconds.\nTo find Billy's final lap time, we perform 600 - 420 - 30 seconds = <<600-420-30=150>>150 seconds.
