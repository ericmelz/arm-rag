These lunches are paid for by making sure the price paid by the paying students is enough to cover everyone's meal. If it costs $210 to feed 50 students, how much do the paying students pay for lunch?\n\nIf 40% of the students receive a free lunch, then 100% - 40% = 60% of the students pay for their lunch.\nIf there are 50 total students, then 0.6 * 50 = <<0.6*50=30>>30 students pay for their lunch.\nThe total cost of feeding all 50 students is $210 and 30 students pay, so each paying student pays $210 / 30 students = $<<210/30=7>>7 each for their lunch.

According to his survey, 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day while the rest gets an average of $4 a day. If he surveyed 60 students, what is the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day?\n\n2/3 of the students receive an average of $6/day, so 60 students x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 students receive $6/day.\nSo, 40 students x $6 = $<<40*6=240>>240 is the amount of money received by those 40 students in a day.\nWhile the rest of the students or 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 students receive $4/day.\nSo, 20 x $4 = $<<20*4=80>>80 is the amount of money received by those 20 students in a day.\nTherefore, the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day is $240 + $80 = $<<240+80=320>>320.

If he surveyed 60 students, what is the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day?\n\nOut of the 60 students surveyed, 2/3 receive $6 allowance per day, so (2/3) x 60 = <<(2/3)*60=40>>40 students receive $6 a day.\nWhile the rest, which is 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 students, receive $4 a day.\nThe total amount of money each day for the 40 students is $6 x 40 = $<<6*40=240>>240.\nMeanwhile, the total amount of money each day for the 20 students is $4 x 20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.\nTherefore, the total amount of money the 60 students get in a day is $240 + $80 = $<<240+80=320>>320.
