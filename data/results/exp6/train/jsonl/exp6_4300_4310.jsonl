If the building is 3/4 occupied for a whole year, and each resident of the building pays a rent of $400, calculate the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives in that year.\n\nIf the building is 3/4 occupied, there are 3/4*100=<<3/4*100=75>>75 units occupied in the building.\nSince each resident pays $400 to stay in the building every month, the 75 units occupied pay $400*75=$<<400*75=30000>>30000 in a month.\nIn a year with 12 months, the amount of money Mr. Maximilian receives is $30000*12 = $<<30000*12=360000>>360000.

If he is currently paid $5000 per month and has to pay 10% tax, calculate his rent expense per month?\n\nIf he is currently paid $5000 per month and has to pay 10% tax, he pays $5000*10/100 = $<<5000*10/100=500>>500 in taxes.\nRhett's total salary after taxes is $5000-$500 = $<<5000-500=4500>>4500\nSince he will pay 3/5 of his next month's salary after taxes to pay for the two late rents, he will pay 3/5*$4500 = $<<3/5*4500=2700>>2700.\nSince the amount he will pay in total is for two late rent payments, his monthly rent expenses are $2700/2 = $<<2700/2=1350>>1350.

The road will be 2000 feet long and 20 feet wide. Each truckload of asphalt will cover 800 square feet of road. If each truckload costs $75, and there's a 20% sales tax, how much will Mark need to pay for asphalt?\n\nThe area of the road is 2000 * 20 = <<2000*20=40000>>40000 square feet,\nso Mark will need 40000 / 800 = <<40000/800=50>>50 truckloads of asphalt.\nThe sales tax will add an additional 75 * 0.2 = $<<75*0.2=15>>15 to the price of a truckload.\nSo the total cost will be 75 + 15 = $<<75+15=90>>90 per truckload.\nThis means Mark will need to pay 50 * 90 = $<<50*90=4500>>4500.

Each truckload of asphalt will cover 800 square feet of road. If each truckload costs $75, and there's a 20% sales tax, how much will Mark need to pay for asphalt?\n\nFirst find the area of the road by multiplying the length by the width: 2000 feet * 20 feet = <<2000*20=40000>>40,000 square feet\nThen divide that number by the number of square feet each truckload covers: 40,000 square feet / 800 square feet/truckload = <<40000/800=50>>50 truckloads\nThen multiply the number of truckloads by the price per truckload to find the total cost before tax: 50 truckloads * $75/truckload = $<<50*75=3750>>3750\nThen multiply that amount by the sales tax rate to find the sales tax amount: $3750 * .2 = $<<3750*.2=750>>750\nThen add the sales tax amount to the total cost before tax to find the total cost: $750 + $3750 = $<<750+3750=4500>>4,500.
