Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?\n\nFirst find the total hourly wages of the warehouse workers: 4 workers * $15/hour = $<<4*15=60>>60/hour\nThen multiply the number of hours worked per day by the number of days worked per month to find the number of hours worked per month: 8 hours/day * 25 days/month = 200 hours/month\nThen multiply the total number of hours worked by the hourly wage to find the total wage cost for the warehouse workers: $60/hour * 200 hours/month = $<<60*200=12000>>12,000/month\nThen find the total hourly wages of the managers: 2 workers * $20/hour = $<<2*20=40>>40/hour\nThen multiply the total number of hours worked by the hourly wage to find the total wage cost for the managers: $40/hour * 200 hours/month = $<<40*200=8000>>8,000/month\nThen add the wage cost of the managers to the wage cost of the workers to find the total wage cost: $8,000/month + $12,000/month = $<<8000+12000=20000>>20,000/month\nThen multiply the total wage cost by the FICA tax rate to find the total FICA taxes owed: $20,000/month * 10% = $<<20000*0.1=2000>>2,000/month\nThen add the wage cost to the FICA taxes to find the total cost: $20,000/month + $2,000/month = $<<20000+2000=22000>>22,000/month.

She get paid $30/hour at her current job, and would get paid $40/hour as a freelancer. However, she'd have to pay an extra $25 a week in FICA taxes plus $400/month in healthcare premiums. How much more would Janet make per month as a freelancer if there are four weeks in a month?\n\nJanet currently makes 40 hours/week * $30/hour = $<<40*30=1200>>1200 per week.\nThus, she currently makes $1200/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<1200*4=4800>>4800 per month.\nAs a freelancer, she would make 40 hours/week * $40/hour = $<<40*40=1600>>1600 per week.\nThus, she would make $1600/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<1600*4=6400>>6400 per month.\nJanet would pay an extra $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<25*4=100>>100 per month in FICA taxes.\nShe would also pay an extra $400/month in healthcare premiums.\nThus, she would make $6400 - $4800 - $100 - $400 = $<<6400-4800-100-400=1100>>1100 more per month as a freelancer.

Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nTo find the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, we need to find the total number of people eaten by the monster in the first three hundred years. We know that over the three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people.\n\nLet's assume that the number of people on the first ship is 'x'.\nIn the second hundred years, there would be 2x people on the ship.\nIn the third hundred years, there would be 2 * 2x = 4x people on the ship.\n\nSo, the total number of people eaten by the monster over the three hundred years is: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.\n\nWe also know that the total number of people eaten by the monster over three hundred years is 847.\n\nTherefore, 7x = 847.\nDividing both sides by 7: x = 121.\n\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years. Answer: \\boxed{121}.\n\n\nQuestion: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's first find out how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the last hundred years. We know that over the three hundred years, the monster has consumed 847 people, and each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Let's assume there were X people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nSince each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the second hundred years is 2*X.\nAnd the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the third hundred years is 2*2*X = 4*X.\n\nTherefore, over the three hundred years, the total number of people consumed by the monster is X + 2*X + 4*X = 7*X = 847.\nTo find X, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: X = 847/7 = <<847/7=121>>121.\n\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years. Answer: \\boxed{121}.\n\n\nQuestion: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's assume that the number of people on the first ship eaten by the deep-sea monster was \"x.\"\nIn the second hundred years, the ship had twice as many people as the first ship, so it had 2x people.\nIn the third hundred years, the ship had twice as many people as the second ship, so it had 2 * (2x) = 4x people.\nOver three hundred years, the total number of people eaten is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847.\nTherefore, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years is x = 847 / 7 = <<847/7=121>>121. Answer: \\boxed{121}.\n\n\nQuestion: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's assume that the first ship had x number of people on it.\nAccording to the problem, the second ship had twice as many people as the first ship, so it had 2x people on it.\nSimilarly, the third ship had twice as many people as the second ship, so it had 4x people on it.\nIn general, we can say that the nth ship had 2^(n-1)x people on it.\nOver three hundred years, the sum of people eaten by the monster is 847 people.\nSo, we can write it as: x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^(n-1)x = 847\nThis is a geometric series, and we can calculate its sum using the formula:\nSum = (first term * (1 - r^n)) / (1 - r), where r is the common ratio.\nIn this case, the common ratio is 2 (as each ship has twice as many people as the previous one), and we want to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\nSo, the equation becomes: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (1 - 2) = 847\nSimplifying further, we get: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (-1) = 847\nOr, x * (2^n - 1) = 847\nLet's solve this equation for n = 3 (as we know the sum of people eaten is 847).\nx * (2^3 - 1) = 847\nx * 7 = 847\nx = 847 / 7\nx = 121\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years.

The next day he walks 6 miles less than half as much as he walked the first day. He walks 10 miles the third day. How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\n\nHalf of what Richard walks the first day is 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 miles.\nThe second day Richard walks 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 miles.\nSo in two days he walks 20+4=<<20+4=24>>24 miles.\nTo get to New York City Richard needs to walk 70-24-10=<<70-24-10=36>>36 more miles.

How many more days are left until all the food runs out?\n", "text": "The provisions in the castle are meant to feed 300 people for 90 days, which means the total provisions can sustain 300 * 90 = 27000 person-days.\n\nAfter 30 days, 100 people leave the castle. Thus, the number of person-days that have been used is 300 * 30 = 9000 person-days.\n\nThe remaining provisions can now sustain 27000 - 9000 = 18000 person-days.\n\nSince the number of people has decreased to 200, we can calculate how many days the remaining provisions can sustain them by dividing 18000 by 200: 18000 / 200 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more days left until all the food runs out. Answer: \\boxed{90}."}
