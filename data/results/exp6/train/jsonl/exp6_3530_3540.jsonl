How many yards of material would be required to make 12 quilts?\n\nIf 21 yards of material can make 7 quilts, then each quilt requires 21/7 = <<21/7=3>>3 yards of material.\nTherefore, 12 quilts would require 12 x 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 yards of material. Answer: \\boxed{36}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jennie makes quilts. She can make 7 quilts with 21 yards of material. How many yards of material would be required to make 12 quilts?\n\nWe can set up and solve a proportion to find the answer.\n\nLet x be the number of yards of material required to make 12 quilts.\n\nWe can set up the proportion:\n\n7 quilts / 21 yards = 12 quilts / x yards\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n\n7 * x = 12 * 21\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n7x = 252\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we get:\n\nx = 36\n\nTherefore, 36 yards of material would be required to make 12 quilts.
