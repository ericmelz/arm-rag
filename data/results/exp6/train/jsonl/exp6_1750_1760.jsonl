How many days of rain can the sewers handle before they overflow?\n\nIn one day, there are 24 hours.\nSo in one day, the sewers can handle 24 hours * 1000 gallons per hour = <<24*1000=24000>>24000 gallons of runoff.\nTherefore, the sewers can handle 240,000 gallons / 24000 gallons per day = <<240000/24000=10>>10 days of rain before they overflow.

How many days of rain can the sewers handle before they overflow?\n\nIn one hour, the sewers produce 1000 gallons of runoff.\nSo, in one day, the sewers produce 1000 gallons/hour * 24 hours/day = <<1000*24=24000>>24000 gallons/day.\nTherefore, the sewers can handle 240,000 gallons / 24,000 gallons/day = <<240000/24000=10>>10 days of rain before they overflow.

How many days of rain can the sewers handle before they overflow?\n\nEach hour, 1000/1000 = <<1000/1000=1>>1 gallon of rainwater is produced.\nSo, the sewers can handle 240,000/1000 = <<240000/1000=240>>240 hours of rain.\nThus, the sewers can handle 240/24 = <<240/24=10>>10 days of rain before they overflow.

How many days of rain can the sewers handle before they overflow?\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many gallons of runoff the sewers can handle per day. Since each hour produces 1000 gallons of runoff and there are 24 hours in a day, the sewers can handle 1000 * 24 = <<1000*24=24000>>24000 gallons of runoff per day.\nNext, we need to calculate how many days of rain the sewers can handle before overflowing by dividing the total capacity of the sewers by the amount of runoff produced per day: 240,000 / 24,000 = <<240000/24000=10>>10 days.

Answer: \\boxed{138}.\n\n\nQuestion: Madeline needs $1200 to pay rent, $400 for groceries, $200 for medical expenses, and $60 for utilities. She also wants to save $200 in case of an emergency. She makes $15 per hour at her job. How many hours will Madeline need to work this month?\n\nMadeline needs a total of $1200 + $400 + $200 + $60 + $200 = $<<1200+400+200+60+200=2060>>2060.\nSince Madeline makes $15 per hour, she needs to work $2060/$15 = <<2060/15=137.33>>137.33 hours.\nSince Madeline cannot work a fraction of an hour, she needs to work for 138 hours.

She makes $15 per hour at her job. How many hours will Madeline need to work this month?\n\nFirst, add up all of the expenses: $1200 + $400 + $200 + $60 + $200 = $<<1200+400+200+60+200=2060>>2060\nThen, divide the total expenses by Madeline's hourly wage: $2060 / $15/hour = <<2060/15=137.33333333333334>>137.33 hours\nMadeline will need to work 138 hours because you can't work a fraction of an hour.
