Later that evening, a squirrel came and ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny had dropped on her way home.  If Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, what is the total number of popcorn kernels she will find remaining on the ground?\n\nJenny drops 5000/25 = 200 kernels of popcorn walking home from school.\nThe next day 200/4 = <<200/4=50>>50 popcorn kernels were eaten by the squirrel.\nIf Jenny counts the following morning, then she will find 200-50 = <<200-50=150>>150 popcorn kernels.

If Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, what is the total number of popcorn kernels she will find remaining on the ground?\n\nJenny walks 5000 feet home from school and drops a kernel of popcorn every 25 feet she walks so she drops 5000/25 = 200 kernels of popcorn\nThe squirrel eats one-quarter of 200 kernels so she eats 200/4 = <<200/4=50>>50 kernels\nIf she dropped 200 kernels and the squirrel ate 50 then the remaining number of kernels is 200-50 = <<200-50=150>>150 popcorn kernels.
