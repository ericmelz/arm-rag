How much, in thousands of dollars, does Danielle pay each month?\n\nThe total cost of the house is $280,000, and Danielle pays a $40,000 deposit, so the remaining balance is $280,000 - $40,000 = $<<280000-40000=240000>>240,000.\nThe balance is spread out over 10 years, so Danielle makes payments for 10 years * 12 months/year = <<10*12=120>>120 months.\nThus, Danielle pays $240,000 / 120 months = $<<240000/120=2000>>2,000 per month for the mortgage.

Answer: \\boxed{78}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bill is buying healthcare on an exchange. The normal monthly price of the plan he wants is $500. The government will pay for part of this cost depending on Bill's income: 90% if he makes less than $10,000, 50% if he makes between $10,001 and $40,000, and 20% if he makes more than $50,000. Bill earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month. How much will Bill spend for health insurance in a year?\n", "text": "Bill earns ($25/hour * 30 hours/week * 4 weeks/month) = $3000/month.\nSo, Bill earns $3000/month * 12 months/year = $<<3000*12=36000>>36000/year.\nIf he makes between $10,001 and $40,000, the government will pay for 50% of the monthly cost.\nSo, Bill will pay only 100% - 50% = 50% of the cost, which is $500 * 50% = $<<500*50*.01=250>>250/month.\nThus, the total amount Bill will pay in a year is $250/month * 12 months/year = $<<250*12=3000>>3000/year. Answer: \\boxed{3000}."}
