He wants to study for a total of 25 hours over the week and divides the remaining amount of study time evenly between Saturday and Sunday. How many hours does Tristan spend studying on Saturday?\n\nOn Tuesday Tristan studies for twice the amount of time he studied on Monday, so he studies for 4 hours * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours.\nOn Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday he studies for 3 hours each day, so he studies for 3 hours * 3 days = <<3*3=9>>9 hours.\nHis total study time up to this point is 4 + 8 + 9 = <<4+8+9=21>>21 hours.\nHe wants to study for 25 \u2013 21 = <<25-21=4>>4 more hours.\nTherefore, he will study 4 hours / 2 days = <<4/2=2>>2 hours each day on Saturday and Sunday.

He took the offer and took the first pair of shoes for $40 and the second one for $60. At the cashier, the lady told him that the offer applies strictly to the cheaper pair of shoes, and also that he was selected for an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. How much money did James end up paying for both pairs of shoes?\n\nThe first pair of shoes cost $40, so the second pair was $40 / 2 = $<<40/2=20>>20 cheaper.\nThat means the price of the second pair is $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.\nIn total, James paid $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for both pairs of shoes.\nThe extra discount is $80 / 4 = $<<80/4=20>>20.\nSo, James ended up paying $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 for both pairs of shoes.
