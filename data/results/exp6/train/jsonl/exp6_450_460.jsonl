There are 16 legs in the pool.\nIf everyone has 2 legs then there must be 16/2 = <<16/2=8>>8 people in the pool\nThere are 14 in the house and 8 are in the pool so that leaves 14-8 = <<14-8=6>>6 people not in the pool. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: An amoeba reproduces by fission, splitting itself into two separate amoebae. An amoeba reproduces every two days. How many days will it take one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae?\n\nSince one amoeba reproduces every two days, the number of amoebae doubles each time. Therefore, to find how many times the amoeba needs to divide to reach 16 amoebae, we can solve the equation 1 * 2^x = 16, where x is the number of divisions.\n\nBy simplifying the equation, we get 2^x = 16. Taking the log base 2 of both sides, we get x = log2(16) = 4.\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 divisions, or 4 * 2 = 8 days, for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

How many days will it take one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae?\n\nEach time the amoeba divides, the number of amoebae doubles. So, in order to increase from 1 to 16 amoebae, the division must occur 4 times: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 8 \u2192 16.\n\nSince the amoeba reproduces every two days, it will take 2 days for each division to occur. Therefore, it will take a total of 4 divisions x 2 days per division = 8 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: An amoeba reproduces by fission, splitting itself into two separate amoebae. An amoeba reproduces every two days. How many days will it take one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae?\n", "text": "Since an amoeba reproduces every two days, we can think about it as a sequence of increasing powers of 2. The sequence would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. \n\nTo determine the number of days it takes for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we need to count the number of terms in the sequence. \n\nSince there are 5 terms in the sequence, it will take 5-1 = 4 divisions for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae. \n\nSince each division takes 2 days, the total number of days would be 4 * 2 = 8 days. \n\nTherefore, it will take 8 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

How much money does Hank donate in total?\n\nHank donates $100 x 0.90 = $<<100*0.9=90>>90 from the carwash.\nHe donates $80 x 0.75 = $<<80*0.75=60>>60 from the bake sale.\nAnd he donates $50 x 1 = $<<50*1=50>>50 from mowing lawns.\nTherefore, Hank donates a total of $90 + $60 + $50 = $<<90+60+50=200>>200. Answer: \\boxed{200}.\n\n\nQuestion: Chad saves 40% of the money he earns/receives in a year.  This year, he made $600 mowing yards and received $250.00 for his birthday/holidays.  He also made $150.00 by selling some old video games and another $150.00 doing odd jobs.  How much will he save?\n", "text": "Chad earned $600.00 mowing yards + $250.00 for holidays + $150.00 selling video games + $150.00 odd jobs = $<<600+250+150+150=1150.00>>1150.00 in total. \nHe saves 40% of his money, so he will save $1150.00 x 40% = $<<1150*40*.01=460.00>>460.00. \nTherefore, Chad will save $460.00. Answer: \\boxed{460}."}
