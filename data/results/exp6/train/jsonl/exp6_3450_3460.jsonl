If the green beans weighed 60 kgs, then how much did the remaining stock weigh?\n\nIf the green beans weighed 60 kgs and the rice weighed 30 kgs less, then the rice weighed 60-30 = <<60-30=30>>30 kgs.\nSince the green beans weigh 10 kgs more than sugar, then the sugar weighs 60-10 =<<60-10=50>>50 kgs.\nAfter losing 1/3 weight of the rice weighing 30 kgs, the weight of the remaining rice was reduced by 30*(1/3) = <<30*(1/3)=10>>10 kgs.\nThe weight of the remaining rice after 1/3 of its weight was lost is 30-10 = <<30-10=20>>20 kgs.\nIf the weight of sugar was reduced by 1/5 after falling, the weight of the remaining sugar is 50*(1-1/5) = <<50*(1-1/5)=40>>40 kgs.\nThe total weight of the rice and sugar after falling is 20+40 = <<20+40=60>>60 kgs.\nIf the green beans weighed 60 kgs and the weight of the rice and sugar after falling is 60 kgs, the remaining stock weighed 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 kgs.
