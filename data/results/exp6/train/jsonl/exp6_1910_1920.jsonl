What is her new salary?\n\nTo determine the new salary, we need to calculate the amount of the increase and add it to the original salary.\n\nThe increase is equal to 2% of the original salary: (2/100) * 10000 = \u20ac<<2/100*10000=200>>200.\n\nAdding this increase to the original salary, the new salary is \u20ac10000 + \u20ac200 = \u20ac<<10000+200=10200>>10200. Answer: \\boxed{10200}.\n\n\nQuestion: A secretary who has been working for 6 years and who earns \u20ac10,000 a month has obtained a salary increase of 2%. What is her new salary?\n\nTo find the new salary, we can multiply the original salary by the percentage of the salary increase. \n\n2% of \u20ac10,000 is (2/100) * \u20ac10,000 = \u20ac200\n\nAdding the increase to the original salary, the new salary is \u20ac10,000 + \u20ac200 = \u20ac<<10000+200=10200>>10,200. Answer: \\boxed{10,200}.\n\n\nQuestion: A secretary who has been working for 6 years and who earns \u20ac10,000 a month has obtained a salary increase of 2%. What is her new salary?\n\nTo calculate the salary increase, we need to multiply the current salary by the percentage increase and add it to the current salary. \n\nThe salary increase in euros is 10,000 * (2/100) = \u20ac<<10000*(2/100)=200>>200.\nSo the new salary is 10,000 + 200 = \u20ac<<10000+200=10200>>10,200. Answer: \\boxed{10,200}.\n\n\nQuestion: In a car dealership, Fiona worked for 40 hours a week, John for 30 hours, and Jeremy for 25 hours. If the employees are paid $20 per hour, how much money does their boss spend paying all of them every month?\n\nFiona earns 40 x $20 = $<<40*20=800>>800 a week.\nSo, she earns $800 x 4 = $<<800*4=3200>>3200 each month.\nJohn earns 30 x $20 = $<<30*20=600>>600 a week.\nSo, he earns $600 x 4 = $<<600*4=2400>>2400 each month.\nJeremy earns 25 x $20 = $<<25*20=500>>500 a week.\nSo, he earns $500 x 4 = $<<500*4=2000>>2000 each month.\nHence, the boss spent $3200 + $2400 + $2000 = $<<3200+2400+2000=7600>>7600 every month for their salary.
