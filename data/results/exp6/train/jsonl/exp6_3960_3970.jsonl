Every A got them 2 extra minutes of recess, for a total of 10 As * 2 extra minutes = <<10*2=20>>20 extra minutes. Every B got them 1 extra minute of recess, for a total of 12 Bs * 1 extra minutes = <<12*1=12>>12 extra minutes. Every C got them 0 extra minutes of recess. Every D lost them 1 minute of recess, for a total of 5 Ds * 1 less minute = <<5*1=5>>5 less minutes. Therefore, the students got 20 minutes + 20 extra minutes + 12 extra minutes - 5 less minutes = <<20+20+12-5=47>>47 minutes of recess that day. Answer: \\boxed{47}."}
