If Jackson eats 1/4 of the salad and 1/5 of the pizza, how many calories does he eat?\n", "text": "The carrots have twice the calories of the lettuce so they are 2*50 = <<2*50=100>>100 calories\nAll together, the salad has 50+100+210 = <<50+100+210=360>>360 calories\nJackson eats 1/4 of the salad so he eats 360*(1/4) = <<360*(1/4) = 90>>90 calories\nThe pepperoni on the pizza is 1/3 the number of calories in the crust so it is 600*(1/3) = <<600*(1/3)=200>>200 calories\nThe total calories in the pizza are the crust calories + pepperoni calories + cheese calories for a total of 600+200+400 = <<600+200+400=1200>>1200 calories\nJackson eats 1/5 of the pizza so he eats 1200*(1/5) = <<1200*(1/5)=240>>240 calories\nIn total, Jackson eats 90+240 = <<90+240=330>>330 calories. Answer: \\boxed{330}."}
