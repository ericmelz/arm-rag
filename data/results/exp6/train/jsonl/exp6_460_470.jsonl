Last year he made $100,000 and got a $10,000 bonus.  This year he makes $200,000.  How much will John make this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together?\n\nFor his salary this year, he will make $200,000.\nThe bonus percentage is 10,000/100,000=<<10000/100000=.1>>.1\nSo his bonus would increase by 200,000*.1=$<<200000*.1=20000>>20,000\nSo his total pay would be 200,000+20,000=$<<200000+20000=220000>>220,000. Answer: \\boxed{220000}.\n\n\nQuestion: John gets a bonus that's the same percentage every year.  Last year he made $100,000 and got a $10,000 bonus.  This year he makes $200,000.  How much will John make this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together?\n\nLast year John got a 10k bonus and this year he will get the same amount so he will get 10k+10k = $<<10+10=20,000>>20,000\nHis pay this year is $200,000 and his bonus is $20,000 for a total of 200+20 = $<<200+20=220,000>>220,000. Answer: \\boxed{220,000}.\n\n\nQuestion: John gets a bonus that's the same percentage every year.  Last year he made $100,000 and got a $10,000 bonus.  This year he makes $200,000.  How much will John make this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together?\n\nFirst, we know that John makes $200,000 a year and gets the same % bonus, so let's assume that bonus is x.\nWe also know that last year John made $100,000, and got a $10,000 bonus, so that means he got 100,000 * x = $10,000.\nWhen we solve it, we get x = $10,000 / $100,000 = 1/10.\nSo his bonus is 1/10 * $200,000 = $<<1/10*200000=20000>>20,000\nSo when we add both his salary and bonus together, we get $200,000 + $20,000 = $<<200000+20000=220000>>220,000. Answer: \\boxed{220,000}.\n\n\nQuestion: John works a job that offers performance bonuses.  He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours.  He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?\n\nFirst find the number of hours John works in a year: 8 hours/day * 365 days/year = <<8*365=2920>>2920 hours/year\nThen multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly rate to find his yearly earnings without the bonus: $80/day * 365 days/year = $<<80*365=29200>>29200/year\nThen find the number of hours he works if he earns the bonus: 8 hours/day + 2 hours/day = <<8+2=10>>10 hours/day\nThen divide the money he makes by the number of hours he works to find his hourly rate with the bonus: ($80/day + $20/day)/10 hours/day = $<<100/10=10>>10/hour.

He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?\n\nJohn works 8+2=<<8+2=10>>10 hours if he tries for the bonus.\nTo make $80 without the bonus he makes 80/8=$<<80/8=10>>10 per hour.\nTo make the bonus each hour is worth 100/10=$<<100/10=10>>10 per hour.
