If Erin watches all of the episodes in one sitting, one after the other with no breaks, how many hours will she spend watching the series?\n\nIf each episode is 50 minutes long, and there are 6 episodes, then the total duration of the mini-series is 50 * 6 = <<50*6=300>>300 minutes.\nAs there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then Erin will spend a total of 300 / 60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours watching the entire series.

If the pot of soup has 6 gallons of soup, how long will it take Erin to serve all the soup, rounded to the nearest minute? (There are 128 ounces to a gallon.)\n", "text": "First, we need to find the total number of ounces in the pot of soup. Since there are 128 ounces in a gallon and the pot has 6 gallons, the total number of ounces is 128 * 6 = 768 ounces.\n\nNext, we divide the total number of ounces by the number of ounces per bowl to find the total number of bowls in the pot. So, 768 ounces / 10 ounces per bowl = 76.8 bowls.\n\nSince Erin can serve 5 bowls per minute, we divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls Erin can serve per minute to find how long it will take her to serve them all. So, 76.8 bowls / 5 bowls per minute = 15.36 minutes.\n\nFinally, we round that number up to the nearest minute because Erin can't serve part of a bowl. Therefore, it will take Erin approximately 15 minutes to serve all the soup. Answer: \\boxed{15}."}
