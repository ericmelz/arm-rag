Since Emily is currently 20 years old and Rachel is 24 years old, the current age difference between them is $24 - 20 = 4$ years.\n\nWhen Emily is half Rachel's age, Rachel's age will be $2 \\cdot (20 - x)$. We want to find the value of $x$ when this expression equals Rachel's age, which is currently 24. So we have:\n\n$2 \\cdot (20 - x) = 24$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$40 - 2x = 24$\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we have:\n\n$-2x = -16$\n\nDividing both sides by -2, we get:\n\n$x = 8$\n\nTherefore, Rachel will be 24 years old when Emily is half her age.

On Wednesdays, there is an additional $10.00 off on all jeans after the summer discount is applied.  Before the sales tax applies, the cost of a pair of jeans is $14.50. How much was the original cost for the jeans before all the discounts?\n\nLet x be the original cost of the jeans.\nThe summer discount on the jeans is x*50% = x*(50/100) = x*(1/2) = x/2\nSo the cost of the jeans after the summer discount is x/2.\nWith the additional Wednesday discount, the cost of the jeans is x/2 - $10.00\nGiven that the cost of the jeans after all the discounts is $14.50, we have the equation x/2 - $10.00 = $14.50.\nAdding $10.00 to both sides of the equation, we have x/2 = $14.50 + $10.00 = $24.50\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we have x = $24.50 * 2 = $<<24.5*2=49.00>>49.00\nTherefore, the original cost of the jeans before all the discounts was $49.00.

How much was the original cost for the jeans before all the discounts?\n\nLet X be the original cost of the jeans.\nAfter the 50% discount, the price of the jeans becomes X - X*50% = X - X/2 = X/2\nAfter the additional $10 discount, the price becomes X/2 - 10.\nWe know that X/2 - 10 = 14.5.\nAdding 10 to both sides, we get X/2 = 24.5.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get X = 49.\nThus, the original cost of the jeans before all the discounts was $49.
