How much will she earn by the end of the week?\n\nFaith earns $13.50 x 8 = $<<13.5*8=108>>108 per day for her regular work hours.\nFaith earns 2 x $13.50 = $<<2*13.5=27>>27 for her overtime hours every day.\nFaith earns a total of $108 + $27 = $<<108+27=135>>135 per day.\nFaith earns a total of $135 x 5 = $<<135*5=675>>675 at the end of the week. Answer: \\boxed{675}.\n\n\nQuestion: Faith is getting paid $13.50 per hour. She normally works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, plus 2 hours of overtime per day. How much will she earn by the end of the week?\n\nFaith's daily earnings for regular working hours: $13.50/hour x 8 hours = $<<13.5*8=108>>108\nFaith's daily earnings for overtime hours: $13.50/hour x 2 hours = $<<13.5*2=27>>27\nTotal daily earnings: $108 + $27 = $<<108+27=135>>135\nWeekly earnings: $135/day x 5 days = $<<135*5=675>>675. Answer: \\boxed{675}.\n\n\nQuestion: Faith is getting paid $13.50 per hour. She normally works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, plus 2 hours of overtime per day. How much will she earn by the end of the week?\n\nFaith earns $13.50 x 8 = $<<13.5*8=108>>108 per day.\nSo, she earns a total of $108 x 5 = $<<108*5=540>>540 for working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.\nWhile working 2 hours overtime per day, she earns $13.50 x 2 = $<<13.5*2=27>>27 per day.\nHence, she earns an additional $27 x 5 = $<<27*5=135>>135 for working 2 hours overtime each day.\nTherefore, Faith will earn a total of $540 + $135 = $<<540+135=675>>675 by the end of the week.

How much change will she receive?\n\nFaith paid a total of $5 + $28 = $<<5+28=33>>33 for her purchases.\nThe two $20 bills amount to $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nSo, the total amount of money that Faith paid is $40 + $3 = $<<40+3=43>>43.\nTherefore, Faith will receive $43 - $33 = $<<43-33=10>>10 in change. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Faith is getting paid $13.50 per hour. She normally works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, plus 2 hours of overtime per day. How much will she earn by the end of the week?\n", "text": "To find out how much Faith will earn by the end of the week, we need to calculate her regular earnings and her overtime earnings separately, and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate Faith's regular earnings:\nFaith earns $13.50 per hour, and she works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So her regular earnings per day can be calculated as:\n$13.50/hour * 8 hours = $108/day\n\nTo calculate her weekly regular earnings, we need to multiply her daily earnings by the number of workdays in a week:\n$108/day * 5 days = $540/week\n\nNext, let's calculate Faith's overtime earnings:\nFaith works 2 hours of overtime per day, and she earns the same hourly rate of $13.50 for overtime. So her overtime earnings per day can be calculated as:\n$13.50/hour * 2 hours = $27/day\n\nTo calculate her weekly overtime earnings, we need to multiply her daily earnings by the number of workdays in a week:\n$27/day * 5 days = $135/week\n\nFinally, let's calculate Faith's total earnings for the week by adding her regular earnings and overtime earnings:\n$540/week + $135/week = $675/week\n\nTherefore, Faith will earn $675 by the end of the week.

The rest of the eggs only have one piece of candy. If Jerry opens one egg at random, what is the percentage chance he'll get 5 pieces of candy?\n\nFirst find what percentage of the Easter eggs are blue: 4/5 * 100% = 80%\nThen find what percentage of the Easter eggs are purple: 1/5 * 100% = 20%\nThen multiply the percentage of purple eggs by the percentage of purple eggs that have 5 pieces of candy to find the percentage chance of getting a 5-candy egg: 20% * 1/2 = 10%\nThen multiply the percentage of blue eggs by the percentage of blue eggs that have 5 pieces of candy to find the percentage chance of getting a 5-candy egg: 80% * 1/4 = 20%\nThen add those two probabilities to find the total probability of getting a 5-candy egg: 20% + 10% = 30%.

The rest of the bags were not chocolate.  How many pieces of candy were not chocolate?\n\nJerry had 63/9 = <<63/9=7>>7 pieces of candy per bag.\n2 + 3 = <<2+3=5>>5 bags had chocolate.\nThus, 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 bags were not chocolate.\nThus, Jerry had 4 * 7 = <<4*7=28>>28 pieces of candy that were not chocolate.

The rest of the bags were not chocolate.  How many pieces of candy were not chocolate?\n\nJerry divided his 63 pieces of candy into 9 bags, so each bag had 63/9 = <<63/9=7>>7 pieces of candy.\nHe had 2 bags with chocolate hearts and 3 bags with chocolate kisses, for a total of 2+3 = <<2+3=5>>5 bags of chocolate candy.\nThus, there were 9-5 = <<9-5=4>>4 bags of candy that were not chocolate.\nSince each bag had 7 pieces of candy, Jerry had 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 pieces of candy that were not chocolate. Answer: \\boxed{28}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jerry has three times as many stickers as George. George has 6 fewer stickers than his brother Fred. If Fred has 18 stickers, how many stickers does Jerry have?\n\nGeorge has 18 - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 stickers.\nJerry has 12 x 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 stickers.
