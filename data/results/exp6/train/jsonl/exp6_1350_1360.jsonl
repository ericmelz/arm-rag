If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?\n\nTo finish in a tie, the hare would need to run 20 feet in the same amount of time it takes the turtle to crawl 20 feet. \nSince the hare runs 10 feet/second, it would take 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds for the hare to run the 20 feet.\nSince the turtle crawls 1 foot/second, it would take 20/1 = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds for the turtle to crawl the 20 feet.\nThus, the turtle needs a head start of 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds to finish in a tie.

She's going to have 80 guests. 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. If each steak entree costs $25 and each chicken entree costs $18, how much is the total catering budget?\n\nIf chicken is x, then the number of guests that have steak is 3*x\n80 = x + 3*x\n4*x = 80\nx = <<20=20>>20\nIf 20 people want chicken then, 80 - 20 = <<80-20=60>>60 people want steak\nIf each steak entree costs $25, then steak expenses = 60*$25 = $<<60*25=1500>>1500\nIf each chicken entree costs $18, then chicken expenses = 20*$18 = $<<20*18=360>>360\nThe total budget is $1500+$360 = $<<1500+360=1860>>1860.

Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?\n\nThe cost of the tickets for the group is 6 * $50 = $<<6*50=300>>300.\nThe cost of the dinner for the group is 6 * $10 = $<<6*10=60>>60.\nHalf of the group buys the drink tickets, so 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 people.\nThe cost of the drink tickets for those three people is 3 * $30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.\nThe total cost for the group is $300 + $60 + $90 = $<<300+60+90=450>>450.\nThe group gets a 90% refund, so they lose 100% - 90% = 10% of the money.\nThe group lost 10% * $450 = $<<10*.01*450=45>>45.
