If the chocolate bars each cost $2, how much did each bag of chips cost?\n\nThe chocolate bars cost Frank 5 * $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThe food items altogether cost Frank $10 + 2*x = $<<10+2*x=20>>20 - $4 = $16.\nThus, 2*x = $16 - $10 = $6.\nSo each bag of chips costs $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Romeo buys five bars of chocolate at $5 each and sells these chocolates for a total of $90.

She paints 6 of her nails purple, 8 of them blue, and the rest striped. What is the difference in percentage points between the percentage of nails painted blue and the percentage painted striped?\n\nThe total number of striped nails is 20 - 6 - 8 = <<20-6-8=6>>6.\nThe percentage of striped nails is 6/20 * 100% = 30%.\nThe difference between the percentage of blue nails and striped nails is 8/20 * 100% - 30% = 40% - 30% = <<8/20*100%-30%=10>>10%.

If there are 16 legs in the pool, how many people are not in the pool?\n\nKaren and Donald have 6 children, so there are (1+1+6)= <<1+1+6=8>>8 people in that family.\nTom and Eva have 4 children, so there are (1+1+4)= <<1+1+4=6>>6 people in that family.\nTogether, there are 8+6= <<8+6=14>>14 people.\nSince there are 16 legs in the pool, that means there are 16/2= <<16/2=8>>8 people in the pool.\nTherefore, there are 14-8= <<14-8=6>>6 people not in the pool. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Johnny is out walking his two dogs at night, and his son joins him for the walk.  How many legs' worth of organisms are traveling together for this walk?\n\nJohnny has two dogs, so that's 2 dogs * 4 legs = <<2*4=8>>8 legs for the dogs.\nJohnny's son has 2 legs.\nSo in total, there are 8 legs from the dogs + 2 legs from Johnny's son + 2 legs from Johnny = <<8+2+2=12>>12 legs in total.

Due to a pandemic, they also had to cut production by another 50%. How many doors will the factory produce?\n\nInitially, the factory planned to produce 200 cars.\nDue to metal shortages, the production decreased by 50 cars: 200 - 50 = <<200-50=150>>150 cars.\nThen, due to the pandemic, they had to cut production by another 50%: 150 * 50/100 = <<150*50/100=75>>75 cars.\nTherefore, the factory will produce 75 cars * 5 doors = <<75*5=375>>375 doors. Answer: \\boxed{375}.\n\n\nQuestion: Sara\u2019s house is 100 square feet larger than 2 times Nada's house.
