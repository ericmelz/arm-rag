How many liters of milk did Bryan buy in total?\n\nThere are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter.\nSo, the 750 milliliters of milk is equal to 750/1000 = <<750/1000=0.75>>0.75 liter.\nThe 250 milliliters of milk is equal to 250/1000 = <<250/1000=0.25>>0.25 liter.\nTherefore, Bryan bought a total of 2 + 0.75 + 0.25 = <<2+0.75+0.25=3>>3 liters of milk.

Since there are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, 750 milliliters is equal to 750/1000 = <<750/1000=0.75>>0.75 liters.\nSimilarly, 250 milliliters is equal to 250/1000 = <<250/1000=0.25>>0.25 liters.\nSo, Bryan bought a total of 2 + 0.75 + 0.25 = <<2+0.75+0.25=3>>3 liters of milk. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jennifer purchased 40 cans of milk at the store before meeting her classmate Mark, who was also buying milk. Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. If Mark purchased 50 cans, how many cans of milk did Jennifer bring home from the store?\n\nJennifer bought 6 additional cans of milk for every 5 cans Mark bought, meaning for Mark's 50 cans, Jennifer could have bought 6/5 * 50 = <<6/5*50=60>>60 more cans.\nThe total number of cans Jennifer could have bought is 60 more cans + the 40 cans she bought = <<60+40=100>>100 cans of milk.

Considering 16 ounces is the same as 1 pound, how much did Jacque's suitcase weigh on the return flight home?\n\nThe perfume weighed 5 bottles * 1.2 ounces = <<5*1.2=6>>6 ounces.\nSo now we a total of 5 pounds to ounces 5 pounds * 16 ounces = <<5*16=80>>80 ounces.\nSo adding the chocolate 80 + 64 = <<80+64=144>>144 ounces.\nSo adding the jars of jam is 144 + 8 + 8 = <<144+8+8=160>>160 ounces.\nSo adding the soap weights 160 + 5 + 5 = <<160+5+5=170>>170 ounces.\nSo adding the perfume its 170 + 6 = <<170+6=176>>176 ounces.\nThen dividing this by 16 ounces, this is 176 / 16 = <<176/16=11>>11 pounds.

The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers\u2019 scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers\u2019 scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n\nFirst, we need to convert the weight limit from pounds to ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in 1 pound, the weight limit is 20 * 16 = <<20*16=320>>320 ounces.\nNext, we need to find the weight of the box without any plates. If each plate weighs 10 ounces, then the weight of the box without any plates is 38 * 10 = <<38*10=380>>380 ounces.\nTo find the number of plates Hasan needs to remove, we subtract the weight of the box without any plates from the weight limit: 380 - 320 = <<380-320=60>>60 ounces.\nSince each plate weighs 10 ounces, Hasan needs to remove 60 / 10 = <<60/10=6>>6 plates from the shipping box.

Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the weight of each plate in pounds. A pound is equal to 16 ounces, so 10 ounces is equal to 10/16 = 5/8 pounds.\nNext, we need to determine how much weight was in the box originally. Since each plate weighs 5/8 pounds, the weight of 38 plates is 5/8 * 38 = <<5/8*38=23.75>>23.75 pounds.\nTo find out how many plates Hasan needs to remove, we need to determine how much weight remains in the box after removing one plate each time. The weight limit for the box is 20 pounds, so Hasan needs to remove 23.75 - 20 = 3.75 pounds.\nSince each plate weighs 5/8 pounds, Hasan needs to remove 3.75 / (5/8) = 3.75 * (8/5) = 6 plates from the shipping box.
