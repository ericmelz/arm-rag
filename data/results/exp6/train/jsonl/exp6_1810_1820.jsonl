If Carson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but gets tired and skips 2 times, how far does he walk in one night?\n\nThe distance around the warehouse is given by the perimeter formula: 2(length + width)\nThe perimeter of the warehouse is 2(600 + 400) = 2(1000) = 2000 feet.\nCarson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but he skips 2 times, so he circles the warehouse 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 times.\nTherefore, Carson walks a total of 8 * 2000 = <<8*2000=16000>>16000 feet in one night. Answer: \\boxed{16000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Carson is a night security guard. He's supposed to patrol the outside of a warehouse that's 600 feet long and 400 feet wide. If Carson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but gets tired and skips 2 times, how far does he walk in one night?\n\nTo find the distance Carson walks in one night, we first need to calculate the total distance he would walk if he completed all 10 circles around the warehouse.\n\nThe distance around the warehouse is equal to the perimeter of a rectangle. The formula to find the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get 2 * (600 + 400) = 2 * (1000) = 2000 feet.\n\nIf Carson were to complete 10 circles, he would walk a total distance of 2000 * 10 = <<2000*10=20000>>20000 feet.\n\nHowever, Carson skips 2 circles, so he walks a total distance of 20000 - (2 * 2000) = <<20000-(2*2000)=16000>>16000 feet. Answer: \\boxed{16000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Carson is refilling his tires. Each tire can hold 500 cubic inches of air. Two of the tires are completely flat and empty. One tire is 40% full and the last tire is 70% full. If Carson injects 50 cubic inches of air with each pump, how many pumps will it take him to fill all the tires?\n", "text": "First find the total amount of air the tires are short: 500 cubic inches/tire * 2 tires = 1000 cubic inches\nThen find how much more air is needed in the 40%-full tire: 500 cubic inches * .6 = 300 cubic inches\nThen find how much more air is needed in the 70%-full tire: 500 cubic inches * .3 = 150 cubic inches\nThen add all the tires together to find the total air needed: 1000 cubic inches + 300 cubic inches + 150 cubic inches = 1450 cubic inches\nThen divide how many cubic inches Carson adds to the tires each pump by his total air needs to find how many pumps he needs: 1450 cubic inches / 50 cubic inches/pump = 29 pumps. Answer: \\boxed{29}."}
