If the previous hay cost $15 per bale, and the better quality one cost $18 per bale, how much more money will Farmer Brown need to meet his own new requirements?\n\nFor the first bales of hay before, it was $15 x 10 = $<<15*10=150>>150.\nThe cost for doubling the hay delivery is 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 bales of hay.\nSo he needs to pay $18 x 20 = $<<18*20=360>>360 for the better quality.\nThus, Farmer Brown would need to pay a total of $360 - $150 = $<<360-150=210>>210 more.

If the previous hay cost $15 per bale, and the better quality one cost $18 per bale, how much more money will Farmer Brown need to meet his own new requirements?\n\nChester previously needed to deliver 10 bales of hay, so the total cost for the previous hay was 10 bales * $15/bale = $<<10*15=150>>150.\nTo meet his new requirement, Farmer Brown wants double the previous delivery, so he now needs 2 * 10 bales = <<2*10=20>>20 bales of hay.\nFarmer Brown now wants a better quality hay, which costs $18 per bale, so the total cost for the new hay is 20 bales * $18/bale = $<<20*18=360>>360.\nThe additional cost Farmer Brown will need to meet his own new requirements is $360 - $150 = $<<360-150=210>>210.

After one year, Mr. Brown sold the house to his other friend with a 10% loss. How much was Mr. Brown's selling price?\n\nMr. Grey's profit is $100,000 x 10/100 = $<<100000*10/100=10000>>10,000.\nSo, Mr. Grey sold the house to Mr. Brown for $100,000 + $10,000 = $<<100000+10000=110000>>110,000.\nMr. Brown's loss is $110,000 x 10/100 = $<<110000*10/100=11000>>11,000.\nTherefore, Mr. Brown sold the house for $110,000 - $11,000 = $<<110000-11000=99000>>99,000.

He wants to know which is the better value, so instead of just looking at the overall price, he looks at the price per ounce. The larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces. The larger box costs $4.80. The smaller box costs $3.40. What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?\n\nThe price per ounce of the larger box is 4.80 dollars / 30 ounces = <<4.80/30=0.16>>0.16 dollars per ounce.\nThis is equivalent to 0.16 dollars * 100 cents/dollar = <<0.16*100=16>>16 cents per ounce.\nThe price per ounce of the smaller box is 3.40 dollars / 20 ounces = <<3.40/20=0.17>>0.17 dollars per ounce.\nThis is equivalent to 0.17 dollars * 100 cents/dollar = <<0.17*100=17>>17 cents per ounce.\nTherefore, the larger box is the better value, with a lower price per ounce of 16 cents. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: Frank goes to the store to buy some food. He buys 5 chocolate bars and 2 bags of chips. He hands the cashier $20 and gets $4 back as change. If the chocolate bars each cost $2, how much did each bag of chips cost?\n\nThe chocolate bars cost Frank 5 * $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThe food items altogether cost Frank $10 + 2*x = $<<10+2*x=20>>20 - $4 = $16.\nThus, 2*x = $16 - $10 = $6.\nSo each bag of chips costs $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Peter goes to the store to buy a soda. The soda costs $.25 an ounce. He brought $2 with him and leaves with $.50. How many ounces of soda did he buy?\n\nPeter brought $2 and left with $0.50, so he spent $2 - $0.50 = $<<2-0.5=1.50>>1.50.\nSince the soda costs $0.25 an ounce, he bought $1.50 / $0.25 = <<1.50/0.25=6>>6 ounces. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two friends, Hubert and Ian, are planning to have a pizza party. One box of pizza is worth $14, and a can of soda is worth $1.80. Hubert orders eight boxes of pizza and ten cans of soda. Ian buys ten boxes of pizza and fifteen cans of soda. How much do they spend in all?\n\nEight boxes of pizza amount to $14 x 8 = $<<14*8=112>>112.\nTen cans of soda amount to $1.80 x 10 = $<<1.80*10=18>>18.\nSo, the total amount that Hubert spent was $112 + $18 = $<<112+18=130>>130.\nTen boxes of pizza amount to $14 x 10 = $<<14*10=140>>140.\nFifteen cans of soda amount to $1.80 x 15 = $<<1.80*15=27>>27.\nSo, the total amount that Ian spent was $140 + $27 = $<<140+27=167>>167.\nTherefore, Hubert and Ian spent $130 + $167 = $<<130+167=297>>297 in all.

After buying the beef and his cheese, he has $61 left. How many pounds of cheese did he buy?\n\nAfter buying the beef, Tony had $87 - $5 = $<<87-5=82>>82 left.\nSo he spent $82 - $61 = $<<82-61=21>>21 on cheese.\nTherefore, Tony bought $21 / $7 = <<21/7=3>>3 pounds of cheese. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: Oliver is trying to decide between two different sized boxes of macaroni and cheese.

How many miles a day does the other dog average?\n\nLet \"x\" be the number of miles the second dog walks per day.\nThe total number of miles the first dog walks per week is 2 miles/day * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 miles/week.\nThe total number of miles the second dog walks per week is x miles/day * 7 days/week = 7x miles/week.\nThe total distance walked by both dogs per week is 14 + 7x = 70 miles/week.\nSubtracting 14 from each side, we get 7x = 70 - 14 = 56 miles/week.\nSo, the second dog walks an average of 56 miles/week / 7 days/week = <<56/7=8>>8 miles/day. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bingo has two dogs. On average, they walk a total of 70 miles a week. The first dog walks an average of 2 miles a day. How many miles a day does the other dog average?\n\nLet \"x\" represent the number of miles the second dog walks per day.\nSo the equation for the total distance walked by both dogs is 2 + x = 70/7 = <<2 + x = 10>>10 miles\nCombining like terms, we get x = 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 miles.\nThe other dog averages 8 miles per day.

On Monday, she needs to walk 4 poodles and 2 Chihuahuas. On Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas but isn't sure how many poodles she should walk. On Wednesday, she walks 4 Labradors. It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?\n\nOn Monday, Charlotte walks 4 poodles * 2 hours per poodle = 8 hours.\nOn Monday, Charlotte walks 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour per Chihuahua = <<2*1=2>>2 hours.\nOn Tuesday, Charlotte walks 2 Chihuahuas * 1 hour per Chihuahua = <<2*1=2>>2 hours.\nOn Wednesday, Charlotte walks 4 Labradors * 3 hours per Labrador = <<4*3=12>>12 hours.\nThe total time spent dog walking, including the time spent on Tuesday, is 8 + 2 + 2 + 12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours.\nThe remaining time for dog walking is 32 hours total - 24 hours spent = <<32-24=8>>8 hours.\nCharlotte can walk 8 hours / 2 hours per poodle = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.

It takes 2 hours to walk a poodle, 1 hour to walk a Chihuahua, and 3 hours to walk a Labrador. If she has time for a total of 32 hours spent in dog-walking this week, how many poodles can Charlotte walk on Tuesday?\n\nOn Monday, it takes Charlotte 2 hours per poodle, so she spends 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 hours walking poodles.\nOn Monday, it takes Charlotte 1 hour per Chihuahua, so she spends 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas.\nOn Tuesday, she walks the same amount of Chihuahuas, so she spends 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours walking Chihuahuas on Tuesday.\nOn Wednesday, it takes Charlotte 3 hours per Labrador, so she spends 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 hours walking Labradors.\nIn total, Charlotte spends 8+2+2+12 = <<8+2+2+12=24>>24 hours walking dogs.\nThis means she has 32 - 24 = <<32-24=8>>8 hours left to walk poodles on Tuesday.\nAs each poodle takes 2 hours to walk, that means Charlotte can walk 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 poodles on Tuesday.
