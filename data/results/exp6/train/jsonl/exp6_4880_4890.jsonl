A milkshake is $5. Cheese fries are $8. They spend 80% of their combined money. If Jim brought $20 how much did his cousin bring?\n\nThe total bill for the cheeseburgers is 2 * $3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nThe total bill for the milkshakes is 2 * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nThe total bill for the cheese fries is $8.\nThus, the total bill is $6 + $10 + $8 = $<<6+10+8=24>>24.\nLet's say they spent x amount of money, and this means 0.8 * x = $24.\nTherefore, x = $24/0.8 = $<<24/0.8=30>>30.\nThis means Jim and his cousin brought $30 together.\nSince Jim brought $20, his cousin brought $30 - $20 = $<<30-20=10>>10. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jim and his Cousin are out at a restaurant. They each order a cheeseburger and milkshake. They also split an order to cheese fries. A cheeseburger is $3. A milkshake is $5. Cheese fries are $8. They spend 80% of their combined money. If Jim brought $20 how much did his cousin bring?\n\nThe total cost per person for a cheeseburger and milkshake is $3 + $5 = $<<3+5=8>>8.\nSo for both of them, the total cost for cheeseburgers and milkshakes is $8 * 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.\nThen the total cost for cheeseburgers, milkshakes, and cheese fries is $16 + $8 = $<<16+8=24>>24.\nTherefore, 80% of their combined money is $24 / 0.8 = $<<24/0.8=30>>30.\nSo Jim's cousin brought $30 - $20 = $10.

His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?\n\nThe cost of half of the food bill is 16+14=<<16+14=30>>30 dollars\nThe tip came out to be 30*.2=$<<30*.2=6>>6\nSo James paid 30/2+6=$<<30/2+6=21>>21. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?\n\nIf Amy got $50, and the ratio of the sharing is 2:1:3, then Sandra received $50*(2/1) = $<<50*(2/1)=100>>100.
