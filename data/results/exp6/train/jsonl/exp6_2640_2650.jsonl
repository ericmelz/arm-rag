What is the area of the rectangle?\n\nTo find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length by its width.\nGiven that the rectangle is 7 inches wide and 4 times as long, we can calculate its length by multiplying the width by 4: 7 inches * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 inches.\nNow we can find the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length by the width: 7 inches * 28 inches = <<7*28=196>>196 square inches.\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 196 square inches. Answer: \\boxed{196}.\n\n\nQuestion: A rectangle has a length of 40 meters and a width of 20 meters. A similar smaller rectangle has half the length and width of the big rectangle. What's the area of the smaller rectangle?\n\nThe length of the smaller rectangle is half of the length of the big rectangle, which is 40 meters / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 meters.\nThe width of the smaller rectangle is also half of the width of the big rectangle, which is 20 meters / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 meters.\nThe area of the smaller rectangle is 20 meters * 10 meters = <<20*10=200>>200 square meters.

Two weeks ago, there were 40 campers which was 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago. How many campers were there last week?\n\nIf \ud835\udc65 represents the number of campers three weeks ago, then 40=\ud835\udc65+10\nThis means the number of campers three weeks ago, \ud835\udc65=40\u221210 = <<40-10=30>>30\nThe total number of campers for the past three weeks is 150, so last week there were 150-40-30= <<150-40-30=80>>80 campers. Answer: \\boxed{80}.\n\n\nQuestion: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's assume that the first ship had x number of people on it.\nAccording to the problem, the second ship had twice as many people as the first ship, so it had 2x people on it.\nSimilarly, the third ship had twice as many people as the second ship, so it had 4x people on it.\nIn general, we can say that the nth ship had 2^(n-1)x people on it.\nOver three hundred years, the sum of people eaten by the monster is 847 people.\nSo, we can write it as: x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^(n-1)x = 847\nThis is a geometric series, and we can calculate its sum using the formula:\nSum = (first term * (1 - r^n)) / (1 - r), where r is the common ratio.\nIn this case, the common ratio is 2 (as each ship has twice as many people as the previous one), and we want to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\nSo, the equation becomes: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (1 - 2) = 847\nSimplifying further, we get: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (-1) = 847\nOr, x * (2^n - 1) = 847\nLet's solve this equation for n = 3 (as we know the sum of people eaten is 847).\nx * (2^3 - 1) = 847\nx * 7 = 847\nx = 847 / 7\nx = 121\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years.

To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\n\nAlice walks 10 miles each morning from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles in the grass field.\nShe also walks 12 miles in the afternoon from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 12 miles * 5 days = <<12*5=60>>60 miles in the forest.\nThus, Alice will have walked a total of 50 miles + 60 miles = <<50+60=110>>110 miles that week. Answer: \\boxed{110}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark is a lawyer who works at the county courthouse every day. It takes him 5 minutes to find parking and 3 minutes to walk into the courthouse. 2 days of the week it takes him 30 minutes to get through the metal detector and the other 3 days are less crowded so he gets through in 10 minutes. How long does he spend on all these activities in a week with 5 work days?\n\nFirst find the total time Mark spends parking by multiplying his parking time per day by the number of days per week: 5 minutes/day * 5 days/week = <<5*5=25>>25 minutes/week\nThen find the total time he spends walking each day by multiplying his walking time per day by the number of days per week: 3 minutes/day * 5 days/week = <<3*5=15>>15 minutes/week\nThen find the total time he spends in the metal detector on busy days by multiplying the number of busy days by the time per busy day: 30 minutes/day * 2 days/week = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes/week\nThen find the total time he spends in the metal detector on less busy days by multiplying the number of less busy days by the time per less busy day: 10 minutes/day * 3 days/week = <<10*3=30>>30 minutes/week\nThen add all the time he spends on each activity to find how much time he spends at the courthouse: 25 minutes + 15 minutes + 60 minutes + 30 minutes = <<25+15+60+30=130>>130 minutes/week.

To avoid the hot afternoon sun on her way home, she walks 12 miles through a forest. When she gets home on Friday, how many miles will she have walked that week?\n\nFrom Monday to Friday, Alice walks a total of 10 miles per day for 5 days, so she walks 10 * 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 miles through the grass field.\nSimilarly, she walks 12 miles per day for 5 days, so she walks 12 * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 miles through the forest.\nTherefore, Alice walks a total of 50 + 60 = <<50+60=110>>110 miles in a week.
