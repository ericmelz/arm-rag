There are 2 ducks with 5 ducklings each, 6 ducks with 3 ducklings each, and 9 ducks with 6 ducklings each. How many ducks and ducklings are there total?\n\nFirst find how many ducklings are with the first group of ducks: 2 ducks * 5 ducklings/duck = <<2*5=10>>10 ducklings\nThen find how many ducklings are with the second group of ducks: 6 ducks * 3 ducklings/duck = <<6*3=18>>18 ducklings\nThen find how many ducklings are with the third group of ducks: 9 ducks * 6 ducklings/duck = <<9*6=54>>54 ducklings\nThen add up the number of each kind of bird to find the total: 2 ducks + 6 ducks + 9 ducks + 10 ducklings + 18 ducklings + 54 ducklings = <<2+6+9+10+18+54=99>>99 ducks and ducklings.

Ann slides down a hill that's 800 feet long at a rate of 40 feet/minute. How much longer does Ann's trip take than Mary?\n\nMary's trip takes 630 / 90 = <<630/90=7>>7 minutes.\nAnn's trip takes 800 / 40 = <<800/40=20>>20 minutes.\nAnn's trip takes 20 - 7 = <<20-7=13>>13 minutes longer than Mary's.

What is the distance between them after 1 hour?\n\nIn one hour, Mary will have traveled 5 miles (5 mph x 1 hour) and Jimmy will have traveled 4 miles (4 mph x 1 hour). Since they are running in opposite directions, the distance between them is the sum of their distances: 5 miles + 4 miles = <<5+4=9>>9 miles.

He has a goal of averaging 30 points per game for the entire 20 game season. How many points does he need to average per game to reach his goal?\n\nTo find out, we need to determine how many points Mitchell needs to score in total for the season. \n\nHe has already played 15 games and wants to play a total of 20, so he has 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 games remaining. \n\nTo average 30 points per game for the entire 20 game season, Mitchell needs to score a total of 30 * 20 = <<30*20=600>>600 points. \n\nHe has already scored 26 * 15 = <<26*15=390>>390 points. \n\nTherefore, he needs to score an additional 600 - 390 = <<600-390=210>>210 points. \n\nTo reach his goal, Mitchell needs to average 210 / 5 = <<210/5=42>>42 points per game for the remaining 5 games.
