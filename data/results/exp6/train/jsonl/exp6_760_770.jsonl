Since 3 people need both meals, we subtract the 3 to get the number of meals that are either kosher or vegan, but not both: 8 + 7 - 3 = <<8+7-3=12>>12.\n\nWe can subtract this result from the total number of clients, 30, to find out how many meals are neither kosher nor vegan: 30 - 12 = <<30-12=18>>18.

How many meals does Megan deliver that are neither kosher nor vegan?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to subtract the total number of vegan and kosher meals from the total number of meals Megan delivers.\n\nOut of 30 clients, 7 need vegan meals and 8 need kosher meals, so a total of 7 + 8 = <<7+8=15>>15 clients either need vegan, kosher, or both meals.\nHowever, three people need meals that are both vegan and kosher, so if we add this number to 15, we are including them twice. Thus we need to subtract 3 from the total number of clients needing vegan or kosher meals\n\nSo, the number of clients needing neither kosher nor vegan meals is 30 - 15 + 3 = <<30-15+3=18>>18. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Megan is delivering meals on wheels. Out of her 30 clients, 7 need vegan meals, 8 need kosher meals, and three people need meals that are both vegan and kosher. How many meals does Megan deliver that are neither kosher nor vegan?\n\nFirst find how many meals are vegan: 7 people * 1 meal/person = <<7*1=7>>7 meals\nThen find how many meals are kosher: 8 people * 1 meal/person = <<8*1=8>>8 meals\nThen find how many meals are both kosher and vegan: 3 meals * 1 person/meal = <<3*1=3>>3 meals\nThen add the number of each kind of meal to find the total number of meals: 7 meals + 8 meals - 3 meals = <<7+8-3=12>>12 meals\nThen subtract the number of each kind of meal from the total number of meals to find the number of meals that are neither kosher nor vegan: 30 meals - 12 meals = <<30-12=18>>18 meals. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Megan works eight hours a day and earns $7.50 per hour.  If she works 20 days a month, how much will be her total earnings for two months of work?\n\nShe earns 7.50 * 8 = $<<7.5*8=60>>60 per day.\nHer total earnings for one month would then be 20 * 60 = $<<20*60=1200>>1200.\nSo for two months, her total earnings would be 2 * 1200 = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400. Answer: \\boxed{2400}.\n\n\nQuestion: Megan is delivering meals on wheels. Out of her 30 clients, 7 need vegan meals, 8 need kosher meals, and three people need meals that are both vegan and kosher. How many meals does Megan deliver that are neither kosher nor vegan?\n", "text": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of clients who need either kosher meals, vegan meals, or both, and subtract that from the total number of clients.\n\nThe number of clients who need kosher meals is 8, the number of clients who need vegan meals is 7, and the number of clients who need both kosher and vegan meals is 3. So, the total number of clients who need kosher or vegan meals is 8 + 7 - 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, Megan delivers 30 - 12 = 18 meals that are neither kosher nor vegan.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{18}."}

Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?\n\nThe first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 1.5 hours.\nThe second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 hours long.\nSo the total movie time is 1.5 + 2 = <<1.5+2=3.5>>3.5 hours.\nThey spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, which is 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.\nSo the total cooking time is 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes.\nTherefore, it took them a total of 3.5 + 0.5 = <<3.5+0.5=4>>4 hours to cook and watch the movies.
