(There are 16 ounces per pound).\n\nThe \"area\" of the TV screen is the length times the width, 48 times 100, or <<48*100=4800>>4800 square inches.\nThe weight of that TV in ounces is 4 times 4800, or <<4*4800=19200>>19,200 ounces.\nThat is 19200 / 16 = <<19200/16=1200>>1200 pounds.\nThe area of brother Bob's TV is 70 times 60, or <<70*60=4200>>4200 square inches.\nThe weight of his TV is 4200 * 4 = <<4200*4=16800>>16,800 ounces.\nThat is 16800 / 16 = <<16800/16=1050>>1050 pounds.\nThus the heavier TV is 1200 - 1050 = <<1200-1050=150>>150 pounds heavier.

If the TVs weigh 4 oz per square inch of screen space, how much more does the heavier TV weigh in pounds? (There are 16 ounces per pound).\n\nFirst find the area of Bill's TV: 48 inches * 100 inches = <<48*100=4800>>4800 square inches\nThen find the area of Bob's TV: 70 inches * 60 inches = <<70*60=4200>>4200 square inches\nThen find the difference in area: 4800 square inches - 4200 square inches = <<4800-4200=600>>600 square inches\nThen multiply the difference in area by the weight per square inch to find the weight difference: 600 square inches * 4 oz/square inch = <<600*4=2400>>2400 ounces\nThen divide the weight difference by the number of ounces per pound to find the weight in pounds: 2400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = <<2400/16=150>>150 pounds.

If the TVs weigh 4 oz per square inch of screen space, how much more does the heavier TV weigh in pounds? (There are 16 ounces per pound).\n\nFirst find the screen area of Bob's TV: 70 inches * 60 inches = <<70*60=4200>>4200 square inches\nThen multiply that number by 4 to find the weight of Bob's TV in ounces: 4200 square inches * 4 oz/square inch = <<4200*4=16800>>16800 ounces\nThen divide that number by the number of ounces per pound to find the weight in pounds: 16800 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = <<16800/16=1050>>1050 pounds\nThen find the screen area of Bill's TV: 48 inches * 100 inches = <<48*100=4800>>4800 square inches\nThen multiply that number by 4 to find the weight of Bill's TV: 4800 square inches * 4 oz/square inch = <<4800*4=19200>>19200 ounces\nThen divide that number by the number of ounces per pound to find the weight in pounds: 19200 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = <<19200/16=1200>>1200 pounds\nThen subtract the weight of Bob's TV from the weight of Bill's TV to find the difference in weight: 1200 pounds - 1050 pounds = <<1200-1050=150>>150 pounds.

Every hour, the ants remove 4 ounces of sugar. The bag of sugar held 24 ounces before it was dropped. After three hours, how many more hours will the ants need to harvest the remaining sugar?\n\nAfter three hours, the ants have removed a total of 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ounces of sugar.\nTherefore, there is 24 - 12 = <<24-12=12>>12 ounces of sugar left to harvest.\nThe ants will need 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 more hours to harvest the remaining sugar.

Every hour, the ants remove 4 ounces of sugar. The bag of sugar held 24 ounces before it was dropped. After three hours, how many more hours will the ants need to harvest the remaining sugar?\n\nIn the first three hours, the ants would have removed 3 hours * 4 ounces/hour = <<3*4=12>>12 ounces of sugar.\nThe amount of sugar remaining after three hours is 24 ounces - 12 ounces = <<24-12=12>>12 ounces.\nTherefore, the ants will need an additional 12 ounces / 4 ounces/hour = <<12/4=3>>3 hours to harvest the remaining sugar.
