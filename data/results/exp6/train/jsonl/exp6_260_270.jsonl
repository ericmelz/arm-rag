How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?\n\nSince shadows stretch an extra 5 feet every hour, 6 hours past noon would result in a total length of 6 * 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 feet.\nSince 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the shadows in inches would be 30 * 12 = <<30*12=360>>360 inches.

How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?\n\nIf the shadows stretch 5 feet every hour, and we want to find the length of the shadows 6 hours past noon, we need to find 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 feet.\nSince 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the shadows 6 hours past noon is 30 * 12 = <<30*12=360>>360 inches.

How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?\n\nIf the shadows are 5 feet per hour past noon every 6 hours the length of the shadows is 5*6 = 30 feet.\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, the length of the shadows in inches is 30*12 = <<30*12=360>>360 inches. Answer: \\boxed{360}.\n\n\nQuestion: Every hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon.  How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?\n\nSince each hour past noon adds an extra 5 feet to the length of the shadow, after 6 hours, the shadows will be 6 * 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 feet long.\nSince there are 12 inches in 1 foot, the shadows will be 30 * 12 = <<30*12=360>>360 inches long. Answer: \\boxed{360}.\n\n\nQuestion: Austin and Jake start descending from the 9th floor of a building at the same time. Austin uses the elevator and Jake uses the stairs, descending 3 steps every second. The stairs have 30 steps across each floor. If the elevator will take a minute to get to ground level, how many seconds later will Jake get to the ground floor?\n\nThere are 30 x 9 = <<30*9=270>>270 steps from the 9th floor to the ground floor.\nThis means Jake will take 270/3 = <<270/3=90>>90 seconds to get to the ground floor.\nSince a minute is equal to 60 seconds, Jake will get to the ground floor 90 - 60 = <<90-60=30>>30 seconds later.

How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?\n", "text": "The length of the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon can be found by multiplying the increase in length per hour (5 feet) by the number of hours (6). This gives us 5 * 6 = 30 feet.\nSince there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can convert the length of the shadows to inches by multiplying 30 feet by 12 inches per foot. This gives us 30 * 12 = 360 inches. Answer: \\boxed{360}."}

Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jimmy is going to sell pizzas at the carnival to make some money. The carnival only gave him 7 hours to do so. He bought a 22kg sack of flour to make his pizzas and he takes 10 min to make each pizza for the customers. At the end of the 7 hours, he saw some flour was left. Knowing that each pizza needs 0.5kg of flour to make, how many pizzas can he make to bring home with the flour left?\n\nFirst, convert the 7 hours into minutes: 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<7*60=420>>420 minutes\nThen, divide the total minutes by the time it takes to make each pizza to find how many pizzas he can make: 420 minutes / 10 minutes/pizza = <<420/10=42>>42 pizzas\nThen, multiply the number of pizzas by the amount of flour each one needs to find the total amount of flour needed: 42 pizzas * 0.5 kg/pizza = <<42*0.5=21>>21 kg\nThen subtract the amount of flour he actually used from the amount he bought to find the amount left: 22 kg - 21 kg = <<22-21=1>>1 kg\nThen divide the amount of flour left by the amount each pizza needs to find the number of pizzas Jimmy can make with the flour left: 1 kg / 0.5 kg/pizza = <<1/0.5=2>>2 pizzas. Answer: \\boxed{2}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jimmy decides to make sandwiches for a picnic.  He makes 8 sandwiches in total, using two slices of bread each.  How many packs of bread does he need to buy to make these sandwiches, assuming he starts with no bread and each pack has 4 slices of bread in it?\n\nEach sandwich uses 2 slices of bread and he wants to make 8 sandwiches in total so he needs 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 slices of bread\nEach pack of bread has 4 slices in it and he needs 16 slices in total so he needs to buy 16/4 = <<16/4=4>>4 packs of bread.

If the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12, how many carnations were in the third bouquet?\n\nThe total number of carnations Trevor bought was 9 + 14 + x = <<9+14+x=23+x>>23 + x.\nWe know that the average is the total sum of objects divided by the number of objects, so 12 = (23 + x) / 3\nThe total sum is product of part of the equation by the divisor, so 36 = 23 + x.\nTo solve the equation we should make x = 36 \u2013 23\nSo the third bouquet had 36 \u2013 23=<<36-23=13>>13 carnations.
