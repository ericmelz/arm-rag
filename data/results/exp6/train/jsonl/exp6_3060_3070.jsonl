If his daily goal is 10,000 steps, how many minutes will it take him to reach his goal?\n\nHe walks 2000 steps in 30 minutes and his goal is 10,000 steps. This means he walks 10000/2000 = <<10000/2000=5>>5 times his goal\nIt takes him 30 minutes to reach 2000 steps and he does this 5 times so it will take him 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes.

Therefore, each person shovels 1000/10 = <<1000/10=100>>100 pounds of coal in 1 day. Half of these ten people is 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 people. Therefore, it will take 5 people 40,000/5 = <<40000/5=8000>>8000 pounds of coal in 1 day. Hence, 5 people will shovel 40,000 pounds of coal in 8000/100 = <<8000/100=80>>80 days.

He manages to double his clean and jerk and increase his snatch by 80%.  What is his new combined total lifting capacity?\n\nHis snatch increased by 50*.8 = <<50*.8=40>>40 kg\nSo now his snatch capacity is 50+40 = <<50+40=90>>90 kg\nHis clean and jerk doubled so it is now 80*2 = <<80*2=160>>160 kg\nHis total capacity is 90+160 = <<90+160=250>>250 kg.
