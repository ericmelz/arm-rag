How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\n\nIf the tank is 1/3 full of water, then the remaining capacity of the tank is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\nIf the tank requires 16 gallons of water to fill, then the capacity of the tank is 16 / (2/3) = <<16/(2/3)=24>>24. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\n\nIf the gauge shows the tank is 1/3 full, then 16 gallons represents 1 - 1/3 = 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the tank's capacity.\nSince 2/3 of the tank's capacity is equal to 16 gallons, then 1/3 of the tank's capacity is equal to 16 gallons / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 gallons.\nTherefore, the tank is full when it is holding 8 gallons x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 gallons of water. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\n\nIf the tank is 1/3 full, and 16 gallons of water are added to fill it, then 16 gallons is 2/3 of the tank's capacity because 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\nThe tank holds 24 gallons because 16 / (2/3) = <<16/(2/3)=24>>24. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: A company has a tank that is already filled at a maximum capacity of 350,000 gallons of water. One day the tank starts losing 32,000 gallons/hour for 5 hours, after that time the company repaired the tank but it wasn't enough because the tank was still losing 10,000 gallons/hour. It stayed like that for 10 hours. In the second attempt, they managed to repair the tank and started filling it with 40,000 gallons/hour. After 3 hours, how many gallons are missing for the tank to be at maximum capacity again?\n", "text": "For the first 5 hours, the tank lost 32,000 gallons/hour * 5 hours = 160,000 gallons.\nFor the next 10 hours, the tank lost 10,000 gallons/hour * 10 hours = 100,000 gallons.\nSo in total, the tank lost 160,000 gallons + 100,000 gallons = 260,000 gallons.\nSo before the repair, the tank was left with 350,000 gallons - 260,000 gallons = 90,000 gallons.\nAfter the repair, the tank has an additional 40,000 gallons/hour * 3 hours = 120,000 gallons.\nSo the final capacity of the tank is 90,000 gallons + 120,000 gallons = 210,000 gallons.\nTherefore, the tank is missing 350,000 gallons - 210,000 gallons = 140,000 gallons to be at maximum capacity again. Answer: \\boxed{140,000}."}
