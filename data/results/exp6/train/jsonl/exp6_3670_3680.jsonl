Another 3 friends join them and ask if they can help with the drawing. Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk as they are counting and the group realizes there isn't enough chalk for everyone. Erika\u2019s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk for them to share and there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?\n\nLet's denote the initial number of pieces of chalk Erika and her siblings had by x.\nAfter losing 2 pieces of chalk, Erika and her siblings have x - 2 pieces of chalk.\nWhen the 3 friends join them, the total number of people drawing becomes 3 siblings + Erika + 3 friends = 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 people.\nWith the 12 additional pieces of chalk, there is now enough chalk for each person to have 3 pieces. Therefore, we have (x - 2) + 12 = 7 * 3.\nSimplifying the equation, we get x + 10 = 21.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 11.\nTherefore, Erika and her siblings originally had 11 pieces of chalk.

Erika\u2019s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk for them to share and there is now enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each. How many pieces of chalk did Erika and her siblings originally have?\n\nErika and her 3 siblings originally had x pieces of chalk.\nAfter Erika loses 2 pieces of chalk, they have x-2 pieces of chalk.\nAfter Erika\u2019s mom brings out another 12 pieces of chalk, there are (x-2)+12 = x+10 pieces of chalk in total.\nThere is enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each, so there are a total of 4 siblings + 3 friends = 7 people sharing the chalk.\nTherefore, there are (x+10)/7 = 3 pieces of chalk each.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 7 gives x+10 = 21.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives x = 11.\nTherefore, Erika and her siblings originally had 11 pieces of chalk.

She can bike 3 mph for two hours before she gets tired, and she can bike 1 mph until she gets home.  How long will it take Diana to get home?\n\nThe distance Diana can travel at 3 mph is 3 mph * 2 hours = <<3*2=6>>6 miles.\nThis leaves her with 10 miles - 6 miles = <<10-6=4>>4 miles left to travel.\nAt a speed of 1 mph, it will take Diana 4 miles / 1 mph = <<4/1=4>>4 hours to get home.\nTherefore, it will take Diana a total of 2 hours + 4 hours = <<2+4=6>>6 hours to get home.

If her total mileage was 10 miles, how far is it, in miles, from Layla's house to the high school?\n\nLet S be the number of miles Layla rode slowly from her house to the high school.\nThus, Layla rode her bicycle from her house to the high school and back, a total of S + S = 2S miles.\nThus, Layla rode a total of 2S + 4 = 10 miles.\nThus, 2S = 6.\nTherefore, the distance from Layla's house to the high school is S = 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 miles.

If he drives at 40 miles per hour and follows the exact same route as Yolanda, how many minutes will it take him to catch her?\n\nSince Yolanda leaves home 15 minutes before her husband, and Yolanda's speed is 20 mph, she has a head-start of 20 * 15 = <<20*15=300>>300 miles.\nHer husband gains on her at a rate of 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 mph.\nSo to catch up, it will take her husband 300 / 20 = <<300/20=15>>15 minutes.

If he wants to make a profit of $20 selling all the pies, how much does he have to charge for each pie if both kinds sell at the same price?\n\nThe cost for the pumpkin pies is 10 * $3 = $<<10*3=30>>30.\nThe cost for the cherry pies is 12 * $5 = $<<12*5=60>>60.\nThe total cost for all the pies is $30 + $60 = $<<30+60=90>>90.\nHe needs to sell all the pies for $90 + $20 = $<<90+20=110>>110.\nHe needs to sell each pie for $110 / (10 + 12) = $<<110/(10+12)=5>>5.

He decides to cut 25 cm off the board. But it turned out longer than the other boards. He had to cut off 7 cm from each to make them the same size. How long were the boards before he cut the 7 cm off?\n\nThe shelf is 143 cm long, and Tom cuts off 25 cm, leaving 143 - 25 = <<143-25=118>>118 cm.\nHe cuts off 7 cm from each of the other boards, so they were the same length as 118 + 7 = <<118+7=125>>125 cm.
