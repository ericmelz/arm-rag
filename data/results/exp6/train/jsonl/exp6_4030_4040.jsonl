Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?\n\nJustine initially had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, so let's assume Bailey had x rubber bands.\nSo, Justine had x + 10 rubber bands.\nJustine had 2 fewer rubber bands than Ylona, so Ylona had x + 10 + 2 = x + 12 rubber bands.\nBailey gave two bands each to Justine and Ylona so he had x - 2 - 2 = x - 4 rubber bands.\nSince Bailey is left with 8 rubber bands, we have x - 4 = 8.\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get x = 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nSo Ylona initially had x + 12 = 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 rubber bands.

One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees.  Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky.  If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?\n\nLet g stand for the number of geese Albert saw in the first formation.\nOne-half of the geese broke off, so g/2 geese are left flying in the V formation.\n4 geese flew up from the trees, so g/2 + 4 = 12.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get g/2 = 8 geese.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get g = 16 geese. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: Albert noticed a flock of geese flying together in a V formation in the sky overhead.  One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees.  Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky.  If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?\n\nLet X be the number of geese in the first formation.\nThe number of geese that break off is X/2.\nThe number of geese that remain flying is X - X/2 = X/2.\nThe number of geese that join the formation later is 4.\nThe final number of geese in the formation is (X/2) + 4 = 12.\nThen (X/2) = 12 - 4 = 8\nThen X = 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?\n\nLet g be the number of geese in the first formation Albert noticed.\nAfter the half broke off, there were g/2 flying in the original formation.\nAfter 4 more geese joined, there were g/2 + 4 in the new formation.\nThus, the total number of geese is g/2 + 4 = 12.\nThus, g/2 = 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8\nFinally, the original number of geese is g = 2 * 8 = <<8*2=16>>16.

If each bird costs $20, how many wings did all the birds have?\n\nJohn got 4*50=$<<4*50=200>>200 from his grandparents\nSo he could buy 200/20=<<200/20=10>>10 birds\nThat means they had a total of 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 wings.
