Half of the class answered green, one-third of the girls answered pink, and the rest of the class answered yellow. If there are 18 girls in the class, how many students like yellow best?\n\nOut of the 30 students in the class, half prefer green, or 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 students.\nThe girls constitute 18 of the 30 students, therefore 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 students are boys.\nIf the girls are 18, then the boys must be 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 students.\n1/3 of the girls, or 1/3*18 = <<1/3*18=6>>6 girls, prefer the color pink.\nThe rest of the girls, or 18-6 = <<18-6=12>>12 girls, like yellow.\nSince 30-15-6 = <<30-15-6=9>>9 students did not answer either green or pink, then 9/12 = <<9/12=0.75>>0.75, or 75%, of the boys did not answer.\nSince there are 12 boys, then 75% of 12 = (0.75)*12 = <<(0.75)*12=9>>9 boys like yellow the best.
