If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?\n", "text": "To determine the total machine operation time required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories, we need to calculate the time required to make the dolls and the time required to make the accessories separately.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time required to make the dolls. We are given that each doll takes 45 seconds to make, and there were 12000 dolls. Therefore, the total time required to make the dolls is 12000 dolls * 45 seconds/doll = 540,000 seconds.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time required to make the accessories. We are given that each doll has 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats. Each accessory takes 10 seconds to make. Therefore, the time required to make the shoes is 12000 dolls * 2 shoes/doll * 10 seconds/shoe = 240,000 seconds. The time required to make the bags is 12000 dolls * 3 bags/doll * 10 seconds/bag = 360,000 seconds. The time required to make the cosmetics is 12000 dolls * 1 set of cosmetics/doll * 10 seconds/set of cosmetics = 120,000 seconds. The time required to make the hats is 12000 dolls * 5 hats/doll * 10 seconds/hat = 600,000 seconds. Therefore, the total machine operation time required for the accessories is 240,000 + 360,000 + 120,000 + 600,000 = 1,320,000 seconds.\n\nTo find the total combined machine operation time, we need to add the time required to make the dolls and the time required to make the accessories. Therefore, the total combined machine operation time is 540,000 + 1,320,000 = 1,860,000 seconds.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{1,860,000}."}

If there were 500 visitors, how many of them did not fall ill?\n\nIf 40 percent of the visitors fell ill, then 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60 percent of the visitors did not fall ill.\nWe can convert this to fraction form as 60/100 = 3/5.\nIf there were 500 visitors, then 3/5 * 500 = <<3/5*500=300>>300 visitors did not fall ill. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: A group of researchers are studying a colony of penguins. Their results show that the size doubled in the first year they watched the colony, then tripled in the next year. This year, however, harsh conditions meant the colony only gained 129 penguins. The colony has 1077 penguins in it now. Each penguin eats one and a half fish every day. How many fish did the whole colony catch per day to eat at the beginning of the first year?\n", "text": "Let X be the number of penguins in the colony at the beginning of the first year.\nIn the first year, the size doubled, so there were 2*X penguins.\nIn the second year, the size tripled, so there were 3*(2*X) = 6*X penguins.\nThe colony only gained 129 penguins this year, so there are 6*X + 129 = 1077 penguins now.\nSubtracting 129 from both sides gives us 6*X = 948.\nDividing both sides by 6 gives us X = 948/6 = 158 penguins.\nEach penguin eats 1.5 fish per day, so the whole colony catches 158*1.5 = 237 fish per day. \nAnswer: \\boxed{237}."}

If the dog is 30 inches long overall, how long is its tail?\n\nLet T be the length of the tail.\nThe body is 2T.\nThe head is (1/6)*(2T)=T/3.\nThe total length is T+(T/3)+(2T)=30.\nCombining like terms, we get T+(T/3)+(2T)=30\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get 3T+T+6T=90\nCombining like terms, we get 10T=90\nDividing both sides by 10, we get T=<<9=9>>9. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: A dog barks 30 times per minute.  If 2 dogs bark 30 times per minute, how many times will they have barked after 10 minutes?\n\nIf one dog barks 30 times per minute and two dogs bark 30 times per minute, then 1 dog barks 2 * 30 = <<1*2*30=60>>60 times.\nSo if two dogs bark 60 times per minute, they will have barked 60 * 10 = <<60*10=600>>600 times.

How many dog paws are on the ground?\n\nIf half of the dogs are standing on their back legs and half are standing on all 4 legs, there are an equal number of dogs in each position.\n\nThus, there are 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 dogs standing on their back legs.\nAnd there are also 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 dogs standing on all 4 legs.\n\nSince a dog has 2 back legs and 4 total legs, there are 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 back dog legs on the ground.\nAnd there are 6 * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 total dog legs on the ground.\n\nThus, there are 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 dog paws on the ground.

If 2 dogs bark 30 times per minute, how many times will they have barked after 10 minutes?\n\nIf 1 dog barks 30 times per minute, the 2 dogs will bark 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 times.\nThe 2 dogs will bark 60*10=<<60*10=600>>600 times after 10 minutes.
