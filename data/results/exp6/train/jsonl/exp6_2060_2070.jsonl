The field is in the shape of a rectangle of length 100 m and width 50 m. What is the distance each player will run, in meters?\n\nTo calculate the distance each player will run, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle field and then multiply it by 6 laps.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2*(length + width)\n\nFor this field, we have: P = 2*(100 + 50) = 2*(150) = 300 meters.\n\nTherefore, each player will run a distance of 300 meters per lap * 6 laps = 1800 meters.
