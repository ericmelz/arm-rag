Then he makes a round trip to the market once during weekends. What is his car's mileage for a typical week?\n\nThe total mileage for the trip to the school and back is 2.5 miles * 2 = <<2.5*2=5>>5 miles.\nIn a week, he makes this trip 4 days/week * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 times.\nSo the total mileage for the trips to the school is 5 miles/trip * 8 trips/week = <<5*8=40>>40 miles/week.\nThe total mileage for the trip to the market is 2 miles * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 miles.\nIn a week, he makes this trip once, so the total mileage for the trips to the market is 4 miles/trip * 1 trip/week = <<4*1=4>>4 miles/week.\nTherefore, his car's mileage for a typical week is 40 miles/week + 4 miles/week = <<40+4=44>>44 miles/week.
