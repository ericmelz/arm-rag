Roger, the oldest one, said that he has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined and that his retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience. Peter said that when he came to the company his daughter was 7 years old, and now she is 19 years old. Tom then said he has twice as many years of experience as Robert. Robert said that he has 4 years of experience less than Peter but 2 more years of experience than Mike. How many more years does Roger have to work before he retires?\n\nLet's analyze the information given:\n\n1) Roger has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined.\nLet's say that the other four coworkers have a combined experience of x years.\nThis means that Roger also has x years of experience.\n\n2) Roger's retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience.\nSince Roger currently has x years of experience, he needs to work for 50 - x years before he retires.\n\n3) Peter said that when he came to the company, his daughter was 7 years old, and now she is 19 years old.\nThis means that Peter has worked for 19 - 7 = 12 years.\n\n4) Tom has twice as many years of experience as Robert.\nLet's say Robert has y years of experience.\nThis means Tom has 2y years of experience.\n\n5) Robert has 4 years of experience less than Peter but 2 more years of experience than Mike.\nLet's say Peter has z years of experience.\nThis means that Robert has z - 4 years of experience.\nMike has z - 4 - 2 = z - 6 years of experience.\n\nTo find the values of x, y, and z, we can start with the information given about Peter, since it is more straightforward.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that Peter has 12 years of experience (z = 12).\n\nNow, let's use the information from point 5:\nRobert has 4 years less than Peter, so y = z - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8.\nMike has 2 years less than Robert, so Mike has y - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 years of experience.\n\nNow let's go back to point 4:\nTom has twice as many years of experience as Robert, so Tom has 2y = 2 * 8 = 16 years of experience.\n\nFinally, we can go back to point 1:\nRoger has the same amount of experience in years as all four of the others combined.\nSo, Roger has x = 12 + 8 + 6 + 16 = 42 years of experience.\n\nRoger's retirement should come when he accumulates 50 years of experience.\nTherefore, he needs to work for 50 - 42 = 8 more years before he retires.

If James' older brother is 4 years older than James, how old is James' older brother?\n\nThree years ago, John was 39-3=<<39-3=36>>36\nSo James will be 36/2=<<36/2=18>>18 in 3 years.\nThat means James is currently 18-6=<<18-6=12>>12\nSo James' older brother is 12+4=<<12+4=16>>16.

Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: A gecko lays 30 eggs per year. 20 percent of them are infertile, and a third of the remaining eggs will not hatch due to calcification issues.  How many eggs actually hatch?\n\nFirst find the number of eggs that aren't infertile: 30 eggs * 80% = <<30*80*.01=24>>24 eggs\nThen divide that number by 3 to find the number of eggs that don't hatch: 24 eggs / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 eggs\nThen subtract that number from the number of eggs that aren't infertile to find the number that do hatch: 24 eggs - 8 eggs = <<24-8=16>>16 eggs. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: A frog lays 800 eggs a year.  10 percent dry up, and 70 percent are eaten.  1/4 of the remaining eggs end up hatching, how many frogs hatch out of the 800?\n\n10% of the eggs dry up so that leaves .10*800 = <<10*.01*800=80>>80 eggs\n70% of the eggs that dont dry up are eaten so that leaves .70*800 = <<70*.01*800=560>>560 eggs\nOut of the 800 eggs there are 80 that dry up, 560 that are eaten so that leaves 800-80-560 = <<800-80-560=160>>160 eggs\n1/4 of the remaining 160 eggs hatch into frogs so that means 160*.25 = <<160*.25=40>>40 frogs hatch.
