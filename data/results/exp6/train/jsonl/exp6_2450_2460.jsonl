How many rungs does he have to climb this time to get the cat down from the tree?\n\nTo get the cat down from the 6-foot tree, Jamie had to climb 12 rungs on his ladder.\nThat means each rung on his ladder is 6/12 = <<6/12=0.5>>0.5 feet.\nIf the tree is 20 feet tall, Jamie needs to climb 20/0.5 = <<20/0.5=40>>40 rungs to get the cat down from the tree.

Answer: \\boxed{97}.\n\n\nQuestion: Balki is counting the number of raisins in boxes of cereal. He counted 437 total raisins in 5 boxes. In one box he counted 72 raisins. In a second box he counted 74 raisins. The other three boxes had the same number each. How many were in each of the other three boxes?\n\nThe sum of the raisins in the two boxes is 72 + 74 = <<72+74=146>>146 raisins.\nSo the three other boxes hold a sum of 437 - 146 = <<437-146=291>>291 raisins.\nThen each of the other three boxes hold 291 / 3 = <<291/3=97>>97 raisins. Answer: \\boxed{97}.\n\n\nQuestion: Balki is counting the number of raisins in boxes of cereal. He counted 437 total raisins in 5 boxes. In one box he counted 72 raisins.

In a second box he counted 74 raisins. The other three boxes had the same number each. How many were in each of the other three boxes?\n", "text": "Balki counted a total of 72 + 74 = <<72+74=146>>146 raisins in two boxes.\nTo find the number of raisins in the other three boxes, we subtract 146 from the total number of raisins: 437 - 146 = <<437-146=291>>291.\nSince the three other boxes have the same number of raisins, we divide 291 by 3 to find how many raisins are in each box.\nThe answer is 291/3 = <<291/3=97>>97. Therefore, there are 97 raisins in each of the other three boxes. Answer: \\boxed{97}."}
