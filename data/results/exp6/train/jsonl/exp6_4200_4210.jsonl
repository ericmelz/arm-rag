The puppy needs to eat 2 ounces of this special dog food per day during the first 60 days of its life.  After that, it needs to eat 4 ounces per day of the special food until it is old enough to eat regular dog food.  If the special dog food is only sold in 5-pound bags, and there are 16 ounces in a pound, how many bags will the family need to buy to feed the puppy until it is old enough to eat regular dog food?\n", "text": "The puppy needs to eat 2 ounces a day for 60 days which means it will eat 2*60= <<2*60=120>>120 ounces of food. Once the puppy turns 60 days old, it will eat 4 ounces of dog food per day. Starting at day 61, the puppy will eat that amount for 365-60= <<365-60=305>>305 days. Over this time, it will eat 4*305= <<4*305=1220>>1220 ounces of dog food. So in total, the puppy will eat 120+1220= <<120+1220=1340>>1340 ounces of dog food. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, then there are 1340/16= <<1340/16=83.75>>83.75 pounds of dog food needed. If the dog food comes in 5-pound bags, then the family will need to buy 83.75/5= <<83.75/5=16.75>>16.75 bags of food. Since they can't buy a fraction of a bag, that means they will have to buy 17 bags of dog food. Answer: \\boxed{17}."}

If she spent $14, how much money is left in her allowance?\n\nLet x be the total amount of Mitzel's allowance.\n35/100 * x = $14.\nSo the allowance is x = $14 * 100/35 = $<<14*100/35=40>>40.\nTherefore, Mitzel is left with $40 - $14 = $<<40-14=26>>26. Answer: \\boxed{26}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance. If she spent $14, how much money is left in her allowance?\n\nIf Mitzel spent $14, and that is 35% of her allowance, then 100% of her allowance is represented by x dollars. We can represent this as the equation 0.35x = 14.\nSince 0.35x = 14, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.35 to get the value of x, finding x = $40.\nThus, the total amount of money left in Mitzel's allowance is $40 - $14 = $<<40-14=26>>26.
