If the chance of randomly picking a yellow marble is 1/4, how many yellow marbles are there?\n\nLet X be the number of yellow marbles.\nThere are a total of X + 7 + 11 = X + 18 marbles.\nThe chance of picking a yellow marble is X / (X + 18) = 1/4.\nThus, 4X = X + 18.\nSo, 3X = 18.\nTherefore, the number of yellow marbles is X = 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: In the jar, there are 7 blue marbles, 11 red marbles, and some yellow marbles. If the chance of randomly picking a yellow marble is 1/4, how many yellow marbles are there?\n\nLet X be the number of yellow marbles.\nThere are a total of 7 + 11 + X marbles, or 18 + X marbles.\nSo, the chance of picking a yellow marble is X / (18 + X).\nIf we express this chance as a fraction, we get X / (18 + X) = 1/4.\nMultiplying both sides by (18 + X), we get X = (18 + X) / 4.\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get 4X = 18 + X.\nSubtracting X from both sides, we get 3X = 18.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get X = 6.\nTherefore, there are 6 yellow marbles. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: In the jar, there are 7 blue marbles, 11 red marbles, and some yellow marbles. If the chance of randomly picking a yellow marble is 1/4, how many yellow marbles are there?\n\nLet the number of yellow marbles be x.\nThe total number of marbles is 7 + 11 + x = 18 + x.\nThe probability of picking a yellow marble is x / (18 + x) = 1/4.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 4(18 + x) gives 4x = 18 + x.\nSubtracting x from both sides of the equation and simplifying the right side gives 3x = 18.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3 gives x = 18/3.\nThus, there are 18/3 = <<18/3=6>>6 yellow marbles.

How many marbles are red?\n\nThe number of white marbles is 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 marbles.\nThere are 12 * 50/100 = <<12*50/100=6>>6 green marbles.\nSo, there is a total of 25 + 6 + 12 + x = 50 marbles.\nThus, x = 50 - 25 - 6 - 12 = <<50-25-6-12=7>>7 marbles are red.

How many marbles are red?\n\nHalf of the marbles are white, so there are 1/2 * 50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25 white marbles.\nThere are 50% fewer green balls than yellow balls, which means there are 50/100 * 12 = <<50/100*12=6>>6 fewer green balls.\nSo there are 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 green balls.\nThat leaves 50 - 25 - 12 - 6 = <<50-25-12-6=7>>7 red balls.
