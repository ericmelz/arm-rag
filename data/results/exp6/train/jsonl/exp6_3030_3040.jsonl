Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon. Ekon watched 17 less than Uma. How many videos did Kelsey watch?\n\nLet X be the number of videos Uma watched.\nSo, Ekon watched X - 17 videos.\nAnd Kelsey watched X - 17 + 43 videos.\nThus, Uma, Ekon, and Kelsey watched X + X - 17 + X - 17 + 43 = 411 videos.\nHence, 3X + 9 = 411.\nThus, 3X = 411 - 9 = 402.\nTherefore, Uma watched X = 402 / 3 = <<402/3=134>>134 videos.\nHence, Kelsey watched 134 - 17 + 43 = <<134-17+43=160>>160 videos. Answer: \\boxed{160}.\n\n\nQuestion: Together 3 friends watched 411 short videos. Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon. Ekon watched 17 less than Uma. How many videos did Kelsey watch?\n\nLet's assume that Uma watched x videos.\nEkon watched x - 17 videos.\nKelsey watched x - 17 + 43 = x + 26 videos.\nTherefore, the total number of videos that Kelsey watched is x + 26, Ekon watched is x - 17, and Uma watched is x.\nSo, the total number of videos watched by the 3 friends is x + (x - 17) + (x + 26) = 3x + 9.\nSince they watched 411 videos in total, 3x + 9 = 411.\nTherefore, 3x = 411 - 9 = 402.\nTherefore, x = 402 / 3 = <<402/3=134>>134.\nTherefore, Kelsey watched x + 26 = 134 + 26 = <<134+26=160>>160 videos.

If they both watched six of the same videos, what's the total number of hours they watched?\n\nThe total number of hours Lila took to watch one video is 100 hours / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 hours.\nWhen they both watched six of the same videos, the total number of hours Lila watched is 6 videos * 50 hours/video = <<6*50=300>>300 hours.\nThe total number of hours Roger watched the six videos is 6 videos * 100 hours / video = <<6*100=600>>600 hours.\nTogether, they watched a total of 600 hours + 300 hours = <<600+300=900>>900 hours. Answer: \\boxed{900}.\n\n\nQuestion: Kimiko watches four YouTube videos. The first video is 2 minutes long, the second video is 4 minutes and 30 seconds, and the last two videos are equal in length.

If there were 500 visitors, how many of them did not fall ill?\n\nIf 40 percent of the visitors fell ill, this means 40/100 * 500 = <<40/100*500=200>>200 visitors fell ill.\nTherefore, 500 - 200 = <<500-200=300>>300 visitors did not fall ill. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: After a visit to the newly opened aquarium, 40 percent of the aquarium visitors fell ill from a mysterious disease. If there were 500 visitors, how many of them did not fall ill?\n\nIf 40 percent of the visitors fell ill, then 100 percent - 40 percent = 60 percent of the visitors did not fall ill.\nThere were 60/100 * 500 = 300 visitors who did not fall ill. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: After a visit to the newly opened aquarium, 40 percent of the aquarium visitors fell ill from a mysterious disease. If there were 500 visitors, how many of them did not fall ill?\n\nIf 40 percent of the visitors fell ill, then 100 percent minus 40 percent, which is 100% - 40% = 60% of the visitors did not fall ill.\nTherefore, 60% of the visitors did not fall ill, and since there were 500 visitors, then 60% of the visitors who did not fall ill is (60/100)*500 = <<(60/100)*500=300>>300 visitors.
