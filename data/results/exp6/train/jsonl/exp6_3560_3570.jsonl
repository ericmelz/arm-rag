She estimates that, despite her best efforts, half of the lettuce will be lost to insects and rabbits. Each lettuce plant is estimated to provide 3 large salads. How many lettuce plants should Anna grow in the garden?\n\nSince half of the lettuce will be lost to insects and rabbits, Anna needs to grow twice as much lettuce as she wants for salads, which means half of her lettuce will be useable.\nIf 12 salads are usable, then twice that amount is cultivated, which means Anna needs to grow 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 salads' worth of lettuce.\nIf each lettuce plant provides 3 salads' worth of lettuce, then Anna needs to grow 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 lettuce plants. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Anna wants to plant red and yellow tulips in the shape of a smiley face. She needs 8 red tulips for each eye and 18 red tulips for the smile. If she needs 9 times the number of tulips in the smile to make the yellow background of the face, how many tulips does she need total?\n\nFirst find how many tulips Anna needs for both eyes: 8 tulips/eye * 2 eyes = <<8*2=16>>16 tulips\nThen find how many tulips Anna needs in total for the smile: 18 tulips/smile * 1 smile = <<18*1=18>>18 tulips\nThen multiply that number by the number of tulips in the smile to find the number of tulips in the yellow background: 18 tulips/smile * 9 tulips/smile = <<18*9=162>>162 tulips\nThen add the number of tulips in the eyes, the smile, and the background to find the total number of tulips: 162 tulips + 18 tulips + 16 tulips = <<162+18+16=196>>196 tulips.

How many liters are in the tank if it now rains for 30 minutes and every 10 minutes 350 liters of rain are added to the tank?\n\nInitially, the tank contained 6000 liters.\nThen, 2000 liters evaporated, leaving 6000 - 2000 = <<6000-2000=4000>>4000 liters in the tank.\nThen, Bob drained 3500 liters, leaving 4000 - 3500 = <<4000-3500=500>>500 liters in the tank.\nEvery ten minutes, 350 liters of rain are added to the tank, so in 30 minutes, 350/10 * 30 = <<350/10*30=1050>>1050 liters of rain are added to the tank.\nThus, the tank now contains 500 + 1050 = <<500+1050=1550>>1550 liters.

How many liters are in the tank if it now rains for 30 minutes and every 10 minutes 350 liters of rain are added to the tank?\n\nThe total amount of water evaporated is 2000 liters.\nThe total amount drained by Bob is 3500 liters.\nSo, the total amount of water taken out of the tank is 2000 + 3500 = <<2000+3500=5500>>5500 liters.\nHence, the tank now has 6000 - 5500 = <<6000-5500=500>>500 liters of water.\nEvery 10 minutes, 350 liters of rain are added to the tank.\nTherefore, in 30 minutes, 350/10 x 30 = <<350/10*30=1050>>1050 liters of rain are added to the tank.\nSo, the tank now has 500 + 1050 = <<500+1050=1550>>1550 liters of water.

How many liters are in the tank if it now rains for 30 minutes and every 10 minutes 350 liters of rain are added to the tank?\n\nAfter evaporation, there were 6000 liters - 2000 liters = <<6000-2000=4000>>4000 liters in the tank.\nAfter Bob drained the water, there were 4000 liters - 3500 liters = <<4000-3500=500>>500 liters in the tank.\nFor every 10 minutes of rain, 350 liters were added, so in 30 minutes 350 liters/10 minutes * 3 = <<350/10*3=1050>>1050 liters were added.\nAfter rain, there are 500 liters + 1050 liters = <<500+1050=1550>>1550 liters in the tank.
