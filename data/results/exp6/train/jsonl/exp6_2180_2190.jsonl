The remaining cost would be split between the six friends. At the car wash, they earn $500. However, Brad decided not to join in the purchase of the car. How much more does each friend have to pay now that Brad isn't participating?\n\nThe total cost of the car is $1700.\nThey earned $500 from the car wash.\nSo, the remaining cost would be $1700 - $500 = $<<1700-500=1200>>1200.\nThe cost to be split between the six friends is $1200 / 6 = $<<1200/6=200>>200 per person.\nSince Brad decides not to join, the cost to be split among the remaining five friends is $1200 / 5 = $<<1200/5=240>>240 per person.\nTherefore, each friend has to pay $240 - $200 = $<<240-200=40>>40 more.

How much money has Jeremy if, before the purchase, he had two times more money, than the cost of the computer itself?\n\nIf Jeremy bought a computer for $3000, he also bought accessories for 10/100*$3000=$<<10/100*3000=300>>300.\nThe whole purchase cost him $3000+$300=$<<3000+300=3300>>3300.\nThis means that before the purchase, Jeremy had 2*$3000=$<<2*3000=6000>>6000.\nSo Jeremy has $6000-$3300=$<<6000-3300=2700>>2700.

If they washed 5 SUVs and 5 trucks, how many cars did they wash?\n\nThe trucks raised 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30.\nThe SUVs raised 5 * 7 = $<<5*7=35>>35.\nSo Laura washed 100 - 30 - 35 = $<<100-30-35=35>>35.\nTherefore, she washed 35 / 5 = <<35/5=7>>7 cars.

How much did he pay for the package?\n\nHe got 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 car washes\nSo he paid 12*15=$<<12*15=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Laura is hosting a carwash. She will charge $5 for a car, $6 for a truck, and $7 for an SUV. They raised $100 in total. If they washed 5 SUVs and 5 trucks, how many cars did they wash?\n\nThe total they raised from the trucks is $6 x 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30.\nThe total they raised from the SUVs is $7 x 5 = $<<7*5=35>>35.\nSo the total they raised for the trucks and SUVs is $30 + $35 = $<<30+35=65>>65.\nTherefore, the total amount they raised for the cars is $100 - $65 = $<<100-65=35>>35.\nHence, they washed $35 / $5 = <<35/5=7>>7 cars.

By how many years will this average increase if the tenth student is (quite strangely) 28 years old?\n", "text": "The average age of the first 9 students is 8 years, so the total age of these 9 students is 9 * 8 = <<9*8=72>>72 years.\n\nIf the tenth student is 28 years old, the sum of the ages of all 10 students is 72 + 28 = <<72+28=100>>100 years.\n\nThe new average age of all 10 students will be 100 years divided by 10 students, which is 100/10 = <<100/10=10>>10 years.\n\nTherefore, the average age will increase by 10 years - 8 years = <<10-8=2>>2 years. Answer: \\boxed{2}."}

How many milligrams of zinc does he eat?\n\nFirst find how many grams total the big antacids weigh by multiplying the number of antacids by the weight per antacid: 2 antacids * 2 grams/antacid = <<2*2=4>>4 grams\nThen multiply that amount by 5% to find how many grams of zinc are in those antacids: 4 grams * 5% = <<4*5*.01=0.2>>0.2 grams\nThen find the total number of grams the small antacids weigh by multiplying the number of antacids by the weight per antacid: 3 antacids * 1 gram/antacid = <<3*1=3>>3 grams\nThen multiply that amount by 15% to find how many grams of zinc are in those antacids: 3 grams * 15% = <<3*15*.01=0.45>>0.45 grams\nThen add the zinc from the two groups of antacids to find the total: 0.45 grams + 0.2 grams = <<0.45+0.2=0.65>>0.65 grams\nThen multiply that amount by 1000 to convert it to milligrams: 0.65 grams * 1000 milligrams/gram = <<0.65*1000=650>>650 milligrams.

If a cup of rice has 10 grams of fat, how many grams of fat does Robbie get in a week?\n\nIn a day, Robbie eats 3 + 2 + 5 = <<3+2+5=10>>10 cups of rice.\nTherefore, he eats 10 x 7 = <<10*7=70>>70 cups of rice in a week.\nThus, he gets 70 x 10 = <<70*10=700>>700 grams of fat in a week.
