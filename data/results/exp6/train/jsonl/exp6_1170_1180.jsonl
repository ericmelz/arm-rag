Answer: \\boxed{2400}.\n\n\nQuestion: Oula and Tona work for a delivery service company, supplying different parts of their state with milk products. They are paid $100 for each delivery made in a day. In a particular month, Oula made 96 deliveries while Tona made 3/4 times as many deliveries as Oula. Calculate their difference in pay that month.\n\nTona made 3/4 times as many deliveries as Oula, a total of 3/4*96 = <<3/4*96=72>>72 deliveries.\nSince they are paid $100 for each delivery made in a day, Tona earned a total of 72*$100 = $<<72*100=7200>>7200 in that month.\nIn the same month, Oula made 96*$100 = $9600.\nTheir difference in pay that month is $9600-$7200 = $<<9600-7200=2400>>2400.
