The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles.

The sandwich he bought was normally $8, but he had a coupon for a quarter of the price off. He then upgraded it with sliced avocado for an extra dollar. After adding a drink and a $3 salad, his total lunch bill was $12. How many dollars did Luca pay for his drink?\n\nLuca saved 8 / 4 = $<<8/4=2>>2 with the coupon.\nWithout the coupon, the sandwich would have cost 8 - 2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.\nIncluding the upgrade, the sandwich cost was 6 + 1 =$<<6+1=7>>7.\nAdding the drink + salad, the total bill was 7 + 3 = $<<7+3=10>>10.\nThus, Luca paid 12 - 10 = $<<12-10=2>>2 for his drink.

He then upgraded it with sliced avocado for an extra dollar. After adding a drink and a $3 salad, his total lunch bill was $12. How many dollars did Luca pay for his drink?\n\nThe quarter of the price off is 8/4 = $<<8/4=2>>2.\nSo the original price of the sandwich Luca bought was 8 - 2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.\nThe price of the sandwich after adding the sliced avocado is 6 + 1 = $<<6+1=7>>7.\nThus, Luca paid 12 - 7 - 3 = $<<12-7-3=2>>2 for his drink.

He then upgraded it with sliced avocado for an extra dollar. After adding a drink and a $3 salad, his total lunch bill was $12. How many dollars did Luca pay for his drink?\n\nLuca got a $8 x 1/4 = $<<8*1/4=2>>2 discount for his sandwich.\nSo the price of the sandwich became $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.\nThe cost of the avocado is $1, so the cost of the sandwich became $6 + $1 = $<<6+1=7>>7.\nThe cost of the sandwich and salad is $7 + $3 = $<<7+3=10>>10.\nTherefore, Luca paid $12 - $10 = $<<12-10=2>>2 for his drink.

How many dollars did Luca pay for his drink?\n\nLuca's sandwich cost $8 - ($8 / 4) = $8 - $2 = $<<8-(8/4)=6>>6 after using the coupon.\nLuca's lunch bill, before paying extra for the avocado, drink, and salad cost $6 + $1 + $3 = $<<6+1+3=10>>10.\nTo find the cost of the drink, you subtract the total bill - sum of all other items.
