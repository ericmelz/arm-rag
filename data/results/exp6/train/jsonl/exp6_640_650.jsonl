Assuming the band plays through their entire repertoire, how many songs will they play on average in the third and fourth sets?\n\nThe first two sets have already been played for a total of 5 + 7 = <<5+7=12>>12 songs.\nIncluding the encore, the band has played 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14 songs.\nThus, there are 30 - 14 = <<30-14=16>>16 songs remaining in the repertoire.\nThe band will play 2 songs in the encore of their third and fourth sets.\nTherefore, on average, there will be 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 songs played per set.

She decided to read one-fourth of the number of pages for each class tomorrow. How many pages will she read tomorrow?\n\nMelody needs to read 20 + 16 + 8 + 12 = <<20+16+8+12=56>>56 pages in total.\nSo, she will read 56 x 1/4 = <<56*1/4=14>>14 pages tomorrow.
