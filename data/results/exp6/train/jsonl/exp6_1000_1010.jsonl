How many kilometers did Rajesh walk?\n\nLet's say Hiro walked a distance of x kilometers.\nThe total distance that Rajesh walked is 4*x - 10 kilometers.\nThe total distance walked by Hiro and Rajesh is x + 4*x - 10 = 25 kilometers.\nCombining like terms, we get 5*x - 10 = 25.\nAdding 10 to both sides, we get 5*x = 35.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get x = 7 kilometers.\nThe total distance that Rajesh walked is 4*7 - 10 = <<4*7-10=18>>18 kilometers.
