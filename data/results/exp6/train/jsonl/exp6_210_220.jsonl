This month, she worked for 160 hours and sold $25000 worth of items. Her monthly budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills and savings is 95% of her total monthly earnings and the rest will be put towards insurance. How much did she allocate to insurance?\n\nKristy's basic salary for the month is $7.50/hour x 160 hours = $<<7.5*160=1200>>1200.\nHer earnings from commission is $25000 x 16/100 = $<<25000*16/100=4000>>4000.\nSo, her total earnings is $1200 + $4000 = $<<1200+4000=5200>>5200.\nHer budget for food, clothing, rent, transportation, bills, and savings is $5200 x 95/100 = $<<5200*95/100=4940>>4940.\nThus, she allocated $5200 - $4940 = $<<5200-4940=260>>260 for insurance.

If the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime in his till, plus a bunch of nickels, how many nickels does Mark get in his change?\n\nMark spends $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25 in total.\nHe hands over $7.00, so he receives $7.00 - $6.25 = $<<7-6.25=0.75>>0.75 in change.\nHe receives 1 quarter worth $0.25 and 1 dime worth $0.10 so his change comes to $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35.\nThis means that Mark must receive $0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40 worth of nickels.\nSince each nickel is worth $0.05, this means that Mark receives $0.40 / $0.05 = <<0.4/0.05=8>>8 nickels. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Rocco stores his coins in piles of 10 coins each. He has 4 piles of quarters, 6 piles of dimes, 9 piles of nickels, and 5 piles of pennies. How much money does Rocco have?\n\nRocco has 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 quarters.\nSo, his quarters amount to 40 x $0.25 = $<<40*0.25=10>>10.\nRocco also has 6 x 10 = <<6*10=60>>60 dimes.\nThus, his dimes amount to 60 x $0.10 = $<<60*0.10=6>>6.\nHe has 9 x 10 = <<9*10=90>>90 nickels.\nTherefore, his nickels amount to 90 x $0.05 = $<<90*0.05=4.5>>4.5.\nRocco has 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 pennies.\nHence, his pennies amount to 50 x $0.01 = $<<50*0.01=0.5>>0.5.\nTherefore, Rocco has $10 + $6 + $4.5 +$0.5 = $<<10+6+4.5+0.5=21>>21. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tim won a $100 raffle.  He gave away 20% to his friend.  How much did he keep?\n\nHe gave his friend 100*.2=$<<100*.2=20>>20\nHe kept 100-20=$<<100-20=80>>80.
