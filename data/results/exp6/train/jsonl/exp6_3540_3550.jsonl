One section that measures 40 feet by 40 feet will be covered with concrete, and the rest needs to be covered in grass seeds. Each bag of grass seeds covers 56 square feet. How many bags of grass seeds does Amanda need?\n\nFirst find the area of the park: 120 ft * 60 ft = <<120*60=7200>>7200 sq ft\nThen find the area of the concrete section: 40 ft * 40 ft = <<40*40=1600>>1600 sq ft\nThen subtract the concrete area from the total area to find the grassy area: 7200 sq ft - 1600 sq ft = <<7200-1600=5600>>5600 sq ft\nThen divide the grassy area by the number of square feet each bag covers to find the number of bags needed: 5600 sq ft / 56 sq ft/bag = <<5600/56=100>>100 bags.
