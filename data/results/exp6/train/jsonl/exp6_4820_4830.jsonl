He drinks 90% of one bottle and gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends. How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?\n\nDanny drinks 90% of one bottle, so he has 100% - 90% = 10% of one bottle left.\nHe gives 70% of two bottles to his friends, so he keeps 100% - 70% = 30% of each of those bottles.\nTherefore, he has a total of 10% + 30% + 30% = <<10+30+30=70>>70% of a bottle left.

How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?\n\nDanny drinks 1 x 90/100 = <<1*90/100=0.9>>0.9 bottle of soda.\nHe gives away 2 x 70/100 = <<2*70/100=1.4>>1.4 bottles of soda to his friends.\nSo Danny is left with 3 - 0.9 - 1.4 = <<3-0.9-1.4=0.7>>0.7 bottle of soda.\nHence, Danny has 0.7/1 x 100 = <<0.7/1*100=70>>70% of a bottle left.

How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?\n\nDanny drinks 90% of one bottle, leaving 100% - 90% = 10% of the first bottle.\nDanny gives each friend 70% of a bottle, so from each of the other two bottles 100% - 70% = 30% remains.\nThus, from the other two bottles together there is 30% + 30% = <<30+30=60>>60% of soda left.\nSo in total, Danny has 10% + 60% = <<10+60=70>>70% of a bottle of soda left. Answer: \\boxed{70}.\n\n\nQuestion: Danny has 3 bottles of soda. He drinks 90% of one bottle and gives 70% of the other two bottles to his friends. How much soda does Danny have left, expressed as a percentage of a bottle?\n\nLet's start by finding out how much soda Danny drinks from one bottle: 90% * 1 bottle = 0.9 bottle\nThen let's find out how much soda Danny gives to his friends in total: 2 bottles * 70% = 1.4 bottles\nNow we need to add that to the soda he drank himself: 0.9 bottles + 1.4 bottles = <<0.9+1.4=2.3>>2.3 bottles\nSince he only had 3 bottles to begin with, he now has 3 bottles - 2.3 bottles = <<3-2.3=0.7>>0.7 bottle\nThat means he has 0.7 bottle / 1 bottle = 70% of a bottle left.

He has to drive 8 miles to the first friend's house, half that distance to the second friend's house, then 3 times the total distance driven so far to get to work. How many miles does Danny drive between the second friend's house and work?\n\nFirst double the distance to the second friend's house: 8 miles * 1/2 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 miles\nThen add the distance to the first friend's house: 4 miles + 8 miles = <<4+8=12>>12 miles\nThen triple that distance to get the final distance: 12 miles * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 miles.

How many times did he score one point, if in total he scored 75 points?\n\nLet's say Tyson scored one point \"x\" times.\nSo Tyson scored 1*x + 3*15 + 2*12 = 75 points.\nSo Tyson scored x + 45 + 24 = 75 points.\nSo Tyson scored x = 75 - 45 - 24 = <<75-45-24=6>>6 one points.

How many times did he score one point, if in total he scored 75 points?\n\nTyson scored 3 * 15 = <<3*15=45>>45 points for three points shoots.\nHe also scored 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 points for two points shoots.\nSo he scored 45 + 24 = <<45+24=69>>69 points for three and two point shoots.\nThat means he scored 75 - 69 = <<75-69=6>>6 points for one point shoots. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tyson played basketball on the schoolyard. He scored three points fifteen times, and two points twelve times. He also scored one point some number of times. How many times did he score one point, if in total he scored 75 points?\n\nLet X be the number of times Tyson scored one point.\nThen Tyson scored one point 1*X = <<1*X=X>>X times.\nWe know that Tyson scored three points 15 times, so his score for three-pointers is 3*15 = <<3*15=45>>45 points.\nAlso, Tyson scored two points 12 times, so his score for two-pointers is 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 points.\nThe total score for basketball in schoolyards is 45+24+1*X = 75.\nThus, 45+24+1*X=75.\nThus, 69+1*X=75.\nThus, 1*X=75-69=6.\nThus, Tyson made one point 6 times.

How many of the balls are neither red nor blue?\n", "text": "To find the number of balls that are neither red nor blue, we can start by finding the number of red balls. Since a quarter of the balls in the ball pit are red, there are 360/4 = <<360/4=90>>90 red balls. \n\nThe remaining balls in the ball pit will be the ones that are not red. So we subtract the number of red balls from the total number of balls: 360 - 90 = <<360-90=270>>270.\n\nNow we need to find the number of blue balls.
