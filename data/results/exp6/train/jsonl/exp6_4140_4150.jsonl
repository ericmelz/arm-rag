He sees one crane that is 228 feet tall finishing a building that was 200 feet tall. He sees another that is 120 feet tall finishing a building that is 100 feet tall. The final crane he sees is 147 feet tall, finishing a building that is 140 feet tall. On average, what percentage taller are the cranes than the building?\n\nFirst find the height difference between the first crane and the building: 228 feet - 200 feet = <<228-200=28>>28 feet\nThen divide that number by the height of the building and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 28 feet / 200 feet * 100% = 14%\nThen find the height difference between the second crane and the building: 120 feet - 100 feet = <<120-100=20>>20 feet\nThen divide that number by the height of the building and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 20 feet / 100 feet * 100% = 20%\nThen find the height difference between the third crane and the building: 147 feet - 140 feet = <<147-140=7>>7 feet\nThen divide that number by the height of the building and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 7 feet / 140 feet * 100% = 5%\nFinally, add the three height differences to find the total height difference: 14% + 20% + 5% = <<14+20+5=39>>39%\nFinally, divide the total height difference by the number of cranes to find the average height difference: 39% / 3 cranes = <<39/3=13>>13%.

To get from one floor to the next, drivers have to drive 800 feet at 10 feet/second. How long, in seconds, does it take to get to the bottom of the garage from the top?\n\nThe total time spent at the gates is 2 minutes/gate * 4 gates = <<2*4=8>>8 minutes\nThe total distance traveled between floors is 12 floors * 800 feet/floor = <<12*800=9600>>9600 feet\nThe total time traveling between floors is 9600 feet * 1 second/10 feet = <<9600/10=960>>960 seconds\nThe total time for the whole trip is 8 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 960 seconds = 480 seconds + 960 seconds = <<8*60+960=1440>>1440 seconds.
