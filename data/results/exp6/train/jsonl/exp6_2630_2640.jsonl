His new apartment cost $2800 per month, which he splits evenly with the roommate.  How much money does he save a year?\n\nHis old rent cost 2*750=$<<2*750=1500>>1500\nSo they each pay 2800/2=$<<2800/2=1400>>1400\nThat means they save 1500-1400=$<<1500-1400=100>>100 per month\nSo they save 100*12=$<<100*12=1200>>1200. Answer: \\boxed{1200}.\n\n\nQuestion: John and his two brothers decide to split the cost of an apartment.  It is 40% more expensive than John's old apartment which costs $1200 per month.  How much does John save per year by splitting the apartment compared to living alone?\n", "text": "His old apartment cost $1200 per month.\nThe new apartment is 40% more expensive than his old apartment, so it costs $1200 + ($1200 * 0.4) = $1680 per month.\nSince John is splitting the cost with his two brothers, he only needs to pay 1/3 of the monthly rent, which is $1680 / 3 = $560 per month.\nJohn saves $1200 - $560 = $640 per month by splitting the apartment.\nTherefore, he saves $640 * 12 = $7680 per year.
