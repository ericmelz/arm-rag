Answer: \\boxed{1680000}.\n\n\nQuestion: A company has 500 employees, each paid $12 per hour, working 10 hours a day, five days a week, 4 weeks a month. In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?\n\nThe total number of employees after the new hires is 500 + 200 = <<500+200=700>>700 employees.\nEvery employee works for a total of 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = <<10*5=50>>50 hours/week.\nIn a month with four weeks, each employee works 50 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = <<50*4=200>>200 hours/month.\nSince all employees are paid $12/hour, they receive a monthly payment of $12/hour * 200 hours/month = $<<12*200=2400>>2400.\nSo the total amount of money the company pays its employees per month is $2400/employee * 700 employees = $<<2400*700=1680000>>1680000.

In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?\n\nIn a day, each employee gets 10 * 12 = $<<10*12=120>>120.\nThis means that every week, each employee gets 120 * 5 = $<<120*5=600>>600.\nSo every month, each employee earns 600 * 4 = $<<600*4=2400>>2400.\nIf the company hires 200 more people, it hires a total of 500 + 200 = <<500+200=700>>700 people.\nThis means that before hiring the new people, the company paid 500 * 2400 = $<<500*2400=1200000>>1200000.\nSo when the company hired new people, it started paying 700 * 2400 = $<<700*2400=1680000>>1680000.

Each phone rep will work 8 hours a day and will be paid $14.00 an hour.  After 5 days, how much will the company pay all 50 new employees?\n\nEach employee will work 8 hours a day for 5 days so they will work 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 hours\nEach employee will be paid $14.00 an hour so they will make 14*40 = $<<14*40=560.00>>560.00\nThe company will pay all 50 employees $560.00 a week so they will have to pay 560*50 = $<<560*50=28000.00>>28,000.00.
