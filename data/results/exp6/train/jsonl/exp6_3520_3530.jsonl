In the first break of the match, the 11 players on the field each take two bottles of water from Samira's box, and at the end of the game, take one more bottle each. How many bottles of water are remaining in Samira's box?\n\nA dozen means 12 bottles, so if Samira has four dozen bottles of water, she has 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 bottles.\nIf all the 11 players on the field take two bottles each, they take a total of 11 * 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 bottles.\nAt the end of the game, the same 11 players take one more bottle each, totaling 11 * 1 = <<11*1=11>>11 bottles.\nSamira's box has 48 - 22 - 11 = <<48-22-11=15>>15 bottles of water.

In the first break of the match, the 11 players on the field each take two bottles of water from Samira's box, and at the end of the game, take one more bottle each. How many bottles of water are remaining in Samira's box?\n\nA dozen water bottles equals 12 bottles.\nTherefore, four dozen water bottles equal 12*4 = <<12*4=48>>48 bottles.\nAfter the first half, the number of bottles that the 11 players took is 11*2 = <<11*2=22>>22\nAfter the match, the number of bottles that the 11 players took is 11*1 = <<11*1=11>>11\nTherefore, the total number of bottles that the players took is 22+11 = <<22+11=33>>33\nThe number of bottles remaining in Samira's box is 48-33= 15.
