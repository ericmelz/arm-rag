For the second half of the year, she increased the mileage to 30 miles per week. How many miles total did she run for the year?\n\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. The first half of the year covers 52 / 2 = <<52/2=26>>26 weeks.\nThus, the total miles ran for the first half of the year is 26 * 20 = <<26*20=520>>520 miles.\nFor the second half of the year, there are also 26 weeks.\nSo, the total miles ran for the second half of the year is 26 * 30 = <<26*30=780>>780 miles.\nTherefore, Nicki ran a total of 520 + 780 = <<520+780=1300>>1300 miles in a year.
