(There are 128 ounces in a gallon.)\n\nThere are a total of 5 rows * 10 chairs = <<5*10=50>>50 chairs.\nSo Bill will fill 50 cups * 6 ounces = <<50*6=300>>300 ounces of water.\nHe will fill 300 ounces / 128 ounces/gallon = <<300/128=2.34375>>2.34375 gallons of water.\nTherefore, 3 gallons - 2.34375 gallons = 0.65625 gallons = <<3-2.34375=0.65625>>0.65625 * 128 ounces/gallon = <<0.65625*128=84>>84 ounces.\nThus, there will be 84 ounces of water left in the cooler.

He sells the computers for 1.4 times the value of the components.  He manages to build 60 computers a month.  He has to pay $5000 a month in rent and another $3000 in non-rent extra expenses a month.  How much profit does he make a month?\n\nHe makes the $800 parts cost * 1.4 markup = $<<800*1.4=1120>>1120 for each computer\nSo he makes a profit of $1120 price - $800 cost = $<<1120-800=320>>320\nThat means his total monthly profit is $320 profit per computer * 60 computers = $<<320*60=19200>>19200\nThe total cost of the non-rent expenses is $5000 rent + $3000 expenses = $<<5000+3000=8000>>8000\nSo his total profit before non-rent expenses is $19200 profit - $8000 non-rent expenses = $<<19200-8000=11200>>11,200.
