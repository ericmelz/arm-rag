The loan has 0% interest if she pays the entire amount back in 5 years, which she decides to do.  If she put $10,000 down as a down payment and her monthly payments are $600.00, how much was her loan for (including the down payment)?\n\nShe puts $10,000.00 down, so we know that 10,000 = $10,000.00 which is the down payment.\nShe pays $600.00 a month for 5 years, so she makes 12*5 = <<12*5=60>>60 monthly payments.\nTo find the loan amount, we solve the equation 600*60 = $<<600*60=36000.00>>36,000.00\nAdding the down payment of $10,000.00 to the final amount of $36,000.00 means the total loan was for 36,000 + 10,000 = <<36000+10000=46000>>46,000.

The second lawsuit has a 50% chance of paying out $1,000,000 if Andy loses and a 50% chance of paying out $2,000,000 if he wins.  Expressed as a percentage, how much more likely is it that Andy loses both lawsuits compared to winning both of them?\n\nFirst we find the probability of Andy winning both suits by multiplying the probabilities of each individual suit: .3 * .5 = <<.3*.5=.15>>.15.\nThen we find the probability of Andy losing both suits by multiplying the probabilities of each individual suit: .7 * .5 = <<.7*.5=.35>>.35.\nTo find the difference between these probabilities we subtract the probability of winning both suits from the probability of losing both suits: .35 - .15 = <<.35-.15=.19999999999999996>>.2.\nThis means it's 20% more likely that Andy loses both suits than wins both suits.
