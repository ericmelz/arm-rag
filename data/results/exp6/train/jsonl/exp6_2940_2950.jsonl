Ascending the mountain decreases its speed by fifty percent, and descending the mountain increases its speed by twenty percent. If the distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles and the distance going down to the foot of the mountain is 72 miles, how many hours will Crystal have to pass the whole mountain?\n\nAscending the mountain decreases the speed of the vehicle by fifty percent, so the speed going up is 30 x 50/100 = <<30*50/100=15>>15 miles per hour.\nThus, the time it will take Crystal to reach the top of the mountain is 60/15 = <<60/15=4>>4 hours.\nDescending the mountain increases the speed of the vehicle by twenty percent, so the speed going down is 30 + (30 x 20/100) = <<30+(30*20/100)=36>>36 miles per hour.\nSo, it will take 72/36 = <<72/36=2>>2 hours for Crystal to get down to the foot of the mountain.\nTherefore, the whole trip will take 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours.

If the distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles and the distance going down to the foot of the mountain is 72 miles, how many hours will Crystal have to pass the whole mountain?\n\nGoing up the mountain, Chrystal's speed is reduced by 50% of 30 mph = 30*(50/100) = <<30*(50/100)=15>>15 mph.\nHer speed going up the mountain is 30 - 15 = <<30-15=15>>15 mph.\nThus, the time Chrystal needs to go up the mountain is 60 miles / 15 mph = <<60/15=4>>4 hours.\nGoing down the mountain, Chrystal's speed is increased by 20/100 * 30 mph = <<20/100*30=6>>6 mph.\nHer speed going down the mountain is 30 + 6 = <<30+6=36>>36 mph.\nThe time Chrystal needs to go down the mountain is 72 miles / 36 mph = <<72/36=2>>2 hours.\nTherefore, Chrystal needs 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours to pass the whole mountain.

If the distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles and the distance going down to the foot of the mountain is 72 miles, how many hours will Crystal have to pass the whole mountain?\n\nTo climb up the mountain, Chrystal's speed would decrease by 30 x 50/100 = <<30*50/100=15>>15 mph.\nSo her speed to climb up the mountain would be 30 - 15 = <<30-15=15>>15 mph.\nThe time it would take Chrystal to climb up the mountain is 60/15 = <<60/15=4>>4 hours.\nTo go down the mountain, her speed would increase by 30 x 20/100 = <<30*20/100=6>>6 mph.\nSo her speed in going down to the foot of the mountain would be 30 + 6 = <<30+6=36>>36 mph.\nThe time it would take Chrystal to go down to the foot of the mountain is 72/36 = <<72/36=2>>2 hours.\nTherefore, Chrystal would need to pass the whole mountain in 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours.

The yellow one is broken and cannot move at all.  If the blue one can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour, at what speed, in miles per hour, can the red car travel?\n\nSince the green one can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue one, then it would travel at 8*80= <<8*80=640>>640 miles per hour.\nSince the red one travels at twice the speed of the green one, then it can travel at 2*640= <<2*640=1280>>1280 miles per hour.
