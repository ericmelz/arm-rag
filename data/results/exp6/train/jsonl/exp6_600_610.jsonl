The gazelle can run for speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.  If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?\n\nThe cheetah can run at a top speed of 60 mph, which is equivalent to 60 * 1.5 = <<60*1.5=90>>90 feet per second.\nThe gazelle can run at a top speed of 40 mph, which is equivalent to 40 * 1.5 = <<40*1.5=60>>60 feet per second.\nThe relative speed between the cheetah and gazelle is 90 - 60 = <<90-60=30>>30 feet per second.\nTo catch up to each other, they need to cover a distance of 210 feet, so the time it would take for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle is 210 / 30 = <<210/30=7>>7 seconds.

If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?\n\nFirst we need to convert the speeds of the cheetah and the gazelle from miles per hour to feet per second.\n60 mph * 1.5 ft/s = <<60*1.5=90>>90 ft/s\n40 mph * 1.5 ft/s = <<40*1.5=60>>60 ft/s\nNext, we need to find the relative speed between the cheetah and the gazelle.\n90 ft/s - 60 ft/s = <<90-60=30>>30 ft/s\nFinally, we can find the time it takes for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle.\n210 ft / 30 ft/s = <<210/30=7>>7 seconds.

If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?\n\nFirst, we need to convert the speeds of the cheetah and the gazelle from miles per hour to feet per second. Since 1 mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, the cheetah's top speed is 60 miles per hour * 1.5 feet per second = <<60*1.5=90>>90 feet per second.\nThe gazelle's top speed is 40 miles per hour * 1.5 feet per second = <<40*1.5=60>>60 feet per second.\nNow, we can calculate how many seconds it will take for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle. Let's assume it takes t seconds.\nDuring this time, the cheetah will travel 90 feet per second * t seconds and the gazelle will travel 60 feet per second * t seconds.\nSince the two animals are initially 210 feet apart, we can set up the following equation: 90t - 60t = 210.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 30t = 210.\nDividing both sides by 30, we find that t = <<210/30=7>>7.\nTherefore, it will take 7 seconds for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle.

Considering the fox would run at a constant speed, what distance would he make during 120 minutes?\n\nTo find the distance the fox would make during 120 minutes, we need to convert minutes to hours since speed is given in kilometers per hour.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, 120 minutes is equal to 120/60 = 2 hours.\n\nThe fox can run at a maximum speed of 50 kilometers per hour, so in 2 hours, it would cover a distance of 50*2 = <<50*2=100>>100 kilometers.

First place will get $200, second place will get $150, third place $120 and the rest of the awards will be paid with the same amount of money. How much money will each writer earn from fourth place onwards?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of prizes that the publishing house will distribute with the same amount of money. We subtract the prizes of the top three places from the total number of prizes to find the number of prizes remaining: 18 - 3 = <<18-3=15>>15 prizes.\nNext, we calculate the amount of money that will be distributed among the top three places: $200 + $150 + $120 = $<<200+150+120=470>>470.\nWe calculate the remaining amount of money by subtracting the total prize money awarded to the top three from the total prize money: $800 - $470 = $<<800-470=330>>330.\nFinally, we divide the remaining amount of money by the number of remaining prize winners to find out how much each writer will earn: $330 / 15 prizes = $<<330/15=22>>22/prize.
