If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?\n\nThe cheetah can run at a top speed of 60 mph, which is equivalent to 60 * 1.5 = <<60*1.5=90>>90 feet per second.\nThe gazelle can run at a top speed of 40 mph, which is equivalent to 40 * 1.5 = <<40*1.5=60>>60 feet per second.\nThe relative speed between the cheetah and gazelle is 90 - 60 = <<90-60=30>>30 feet per second.\nTo catch up to each other, they need to cover a distance of 210 feet, so the time it would take for the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle is 210 / 30 = <<210/30=7>>7 seconds.

How many hours does Steve spend with his family in a day?\n\nThe fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12).\n\nTo simplify the last fraction, we need to find the least common multiple of 3, 6, and 12.\n\n3 = 3 \u00d7 1,\n6 = 3 \u00d7 2,\n12 = 3 \u00d7 4.\n\nThe least common multiple is 3 \u00d7 4 = <<3*4=12>>12.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12) = (12/12 - 4/12 - 2/12 - 1/12) = 5/12.\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, Steve spends (5/12) \u00d7 24 = <<(5/12)*24=10>>10 hours with his family. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: The ratio of boys to girls in a family is 5:7. The total number of children in the family is 180.

On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better.  How many pills are left in the bottle?\n\nFor the first 2 days, he takes 2 pills * 3 times a day = <<2*3=6>>6 pills each day.\nOver these 2 days he will have taken 6 pills * 2 days = <<6*2=12>>12 pills\nFor the next 3 days he cuts his intake in half, meaning he only takes 2 pills / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 pill three times a day\nIn total this amounts to 1 pill * 3 times a day = <<1*3=3>>3 pills a day\nThus over these 3 days he will have taken 3 pills * 3 days = <<3*3=9>>9 pills\nOn the sixth day, he takes 2 pills in the morning, putting his total count at 12 + 9 + 2 = <<12+9+2=23>>23 pills.\nThus there are 50 pills - 23 pills = <<50-23=27>>27 pills left.

The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?\n\nTony drives 120 miles in 3 hours, so his speed is 120/3 = <<120/3=40>>40 miles per hour.\nSince his speed is 40 miles per hour, the drive to his second friend's house will take him 200/40 = <<200/40=5>>5 hours.
