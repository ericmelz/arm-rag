How many miles further does Richard have to walk to be in New York City?\n\nHalf as much as the first day is 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 miles.\nThe second day he walks 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 miles.\nFor the first three days he walks a total of 20+10+4=<<20+10+4=34>>34 miles.\nTo be in New York City Richard has to walk 70-34=<<70-34=36>>36 more miles.

During the second third of his trip, riding uphill, he travels a speed of 12 miles per hour.  During the last third of his trip, he rides downhill at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.
