How many times does she fill it to complete the measurements?\n\nTo measure 2 cups of flour, Felicia fills the scoop 8 times because 2 / (1/4) = 8\nShe fills the scoop 4 times with white sugar because 1 / (1/4) = <<1/(1/4)=4>>4\nShe fills the cup 2 times with oil because (1/2) / (1/4) = <<(1/2)/(1/4)=2>>2\nShe fills the scoop 1 time with brown sugar because (1/4) / (1/4) = 1\nOverall, she fills the scoop 15 times because 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = <<8+4+2+1=15>>15. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?\n\nIf Carla represents C, and Frankie represents F, then it states that C+F=30..Frankie wins half as many games as does Carla, so if we represent the games Frankie wins as X, then C=2X, if we add those statements together, we get C+F=30 so 2X+X=30..combining like terms, we get 3X=30..translating that into X by dividing both sides by 3, we get X=10..so if X=10, then Carlos won 10*2= <<10*2=20>>20 games. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Frank has three less than half the number of cookies as Mike. Mike has three times as many cookies as Millie. If Millie has 4 cookies, how many cookies does Frank have?\n\nFirst triple the number of cookies that Millie has, performing 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12.\nThen divide this number in half, performing 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6.\nThus, Frank has 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 cookies.

Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark had 10 pieces of fruit to eat in school this week. On Friday, he decided to keep 2 pieces of fruit for next week. He then brings the remaining 3 pieces of fruit to school for the day. How many pieces of fruit did Mark eat in the first four days of the week?\n\nBefore Friday, Mark had 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 pieces of fruit left.\nTherefore, Mark ate 8 - 3 = <<8-3=5>>5 pieces of fruit in the first four days of the week. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: It is recommended that men should consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day. Mark took a soft drink in the afternoon that contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar. Then he bought some bars of candy which had 25 calories of added sugar each. If he eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, how many bars of candy did he take?\n", "text": "Mark consumed 2500 x 5/100 = <<2500*5/100=125>>125 calories of added sugar from the soft drink.\nHe was already exceeding the recommended intake by 125 x 100/150 = <<125*100/150=83.33333333333334>>83.33%\nSo, he should consume no more than 150 x 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 calories of added sugar.\nMark consumed 300 - 125 = <<300-125=175>>175 calories of added sugar from the candy bars.\nTherefore, he took 175/25 = <<175/25=7>>7 bars of candy.
