Answer: \\boxed{220}.\n\n\nQuestion: Wally gives 3/4 of his 400 tickets to his two friends Jensen and Finley, who share the tickets in a ratio of 4:11. How many tickets does Finley get?\n\nThere are a total of 3/4 x 400 = <<3/4*400=300>>300 tickets that Wally gives to his two friends.\nSo the total ratio of the tickets that his two friends share is 4+11 = <<4+11=15>>15\nSince 15 is equal to 300, since Finley's share is 11, then 11/15 x 300 = <<11/15*300=220>>220 tickets is the number of tickets that Finley gets.
