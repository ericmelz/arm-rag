How many dollars is one child's ticket?\n\nThe adults' tickets cost 10 x $8 = $<<10*8=80>>80.\nThe 11 tickets for children cost a total of $124 - $80 = $<<124-80=44>>44.\nSo, each child's ticket costs $44/ 11 = $<<44/11=4>>4. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: Ten adults went to a ball game with eleven children. Adult tickets are $8 each and the total bill was $124. How many dollars is one child's ticket?\n\nLet $c$ be the cost of one child's ticket.\nThe combined cost of the adult\u2019s tickets is 10 \u00d7 $8 = $<<10*8=80>>80.\nThe combined cost of all the tickets is $80 + 11c = $124\nThus 11c = $124 - $80 = $<<124-80=44>>44.\nThus the cost of one child's ticket is $44 / 11 = $<<44/11=4>>4.

How many dollars is one child's ticket?\n\nLet \"x\" be the cost of one child's ticket.\nThe total cost of the adult tickets is 10 * $8 = $<<10*8=80>>80.\nSo, the cost of one child's ticket is $124 - $80 = $<<124-80=44>>44.\nTherefore, one child's ticket cost to $44 / 11 children = $<<44/11=4>>4 per child. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: Ten adults went to a ball game with eleven children. Adult tickets are $8 each and the total bill was $124. How many dollars is one child's ticket?\n\nLet x be the cost of a child's ticket.\nThe total cost of the adult tickets was 10 * 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 dollars.\nThe cost of the children's tickets was 11 * x = <<11*x=11x>>11x dollars.\nThe total cost was 80 + 11x = <<80+11*x=11x+80>>11x + 80 dollars.\nThe total cost was equal to 124, so 11x + 80 = 124.\nSubtracting 80 from both sides of the equation, we get 11x = 44.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get x = 4 dollars.

How many dollars is one child's ticket?\n", "text": "Let's assume the cost of one child's ticket is $x. Then, the total cost of the adult tickets would be 10 * $8 = $80. The total cost of all the tickets can be represented as $80 + 11x. According to the problem, the total bill was $124. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n$80 + 11x = $124\n\nTo find the value of x, we can subtract $80 from both sides of the equation:\n\n11x = $124 - $80\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n11x = $44\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n\nx = $44 / 11\n\nSimplifying further, we find:\n\nx = $4\n\nTherefore, one child's ticket costs $4.
