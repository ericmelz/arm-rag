Each car has 5 wheels (including one spare) and each motorcycle has 2 wheels. There are 19 cars in the parking lot. Altogether all vehicles have 117 wheels. How many motorcycles are at the parking lot?\n\nLet the number of motorcycles be m then the number of wheels from motorcycles is 2m.\nThe number of wheels from the cars is 5*19=<<5*19=95>>95.\nAltogether, the vehicles have 95+2m=117 wheels.\nSo 2m=117-95=22.\nTherefore m=<<11=11>>11 motorcycles.

There are 19 cars in the parking lot. Altogether all vehicles have 117 wheels. How many motorcycles are at the parking lot?\n\nThe total number of wheels of the cars in the parking lot is 19 cars \u00d7 5 wheels = <<19*5=95>>95 wheels.\nThe number of motorcycle wheels is: 117 wheels - 95 wheels = <<117-95=22>>22 wheels.\nHence the number of motorcycles in the parking lot is 22 wheels \u00f7 2 wheels each motorcycle = <<22/2=11>>11 motorcycles.

There are 19 cars in the parking lot. Altogether all vehicles have 117 wheels. How many motorcycles are at the parking lot?\n\nThere are 19 cars in the parking lot, so the total number of car wheels is 19 x 5 = <<19*5=95>>95 wheels.\nIf we subtract the wheels from the motorcycles, we find there are 117 - 95 = <<117-95=22>>22 motorcycle wheels.\nThis means there are 22 / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 motorcycles at the parking lot.

There are 19 cars in the parking lot. Altogether all vehicles have 117 wheels. How many motorcycles are at the parking lot?\n", "text": "Let the number of motorcycles be m, and the number of cars be c.\nSince each car has 5 wheels, the total number of wheels from the cars is 5c.\nSince each motorcycle has 2 wheels, the total number of wheels from the motorcycles is 2m.\nGiven that there are 19 cars in the parking lot, we have the equation c = 19.\nAlso, the total number of wheels from all vehicles is 117, so we have the equation 5c + 2m = 117.\nSubstituting c = 19 into the second equation, we get 5(19) + 2m = 117.\nSimplifying, we have 95 + 2m = 117.\nSubtracting 95 from both sides, we have 2m = 22.\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that m = 11.\nTherefore, there are 11 motorcycles at the parking lot.

Solving $60 + $5 = $<<60+5=65>>65.\nHe is paid $8 per hour to babysit his little sister and he worked 9 hours for a total of 9*8 = $<<9*8=72>>72.\nAfter buying his video game and candy, he will have $72 - $65 = $<<72-65=7>>7 remaining.

A gallon of paint costs $45 and can cover up to 400 square feet. How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?\n\nThe total area of their walls is 1600 square feet x 2 = <<1600*2=3200>>3200 square feet.\nSo, they will need 3200 square feet / 400 square feet/gallon = <<3200/400=8>>8 gallons of paint.\nSo, the total cost of the paint is $45/gallon x 8 gallons = $<<45*8=360>>360.\nTherefore, Jason and Jeremy will contribute $360/2 = $<<360/2=180>>180 each.

How much will each of them contribute to the cost of the paint if their walls have a total area of 1600 square feet and will need a second coat?\n\nThey need a gallon of paint for every 400 square feet so they will need 1600/400 = <<1600/400=4>>4 gallons for the first coat.\nSince a gallon of paint costs $45, then 1 gallon of paint costs $45 per gallon x 4 gallons = $<<45*4=180>>180 for the first coat.\nSince they will need a second coat, then they will need a total of 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 gallons of paint.\nTherefore, the total cost of the paint is $45 x 8 = $<<45*8=360>>360.\nHence, each of them will contribute $360 / 2 = $<<360/2=180>>180 for the cost of the paint.

How much does he spend in total?\n\nThe cost to fix the wall is 1200/6 = $<<1200/6=200>>200.\nThus, Jason will spend 1200 + 200 = $<<1200+200=1400>>1400 in total.
