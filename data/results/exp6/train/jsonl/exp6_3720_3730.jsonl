On average, how many pastries does he sell on each day of the week?\n\nTo find the average number of pastries sold per day, we need to find the total number of pastries sold in a week and then divide by 7 (the number of days he works).\n\nOn Monday, the baker sold 2 pastries.\nOn Tuesday, the baker sold 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 pastries.\nOn Wednesday, the baker sold 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 pastries.\nOn Thursday, the baker sold 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 pastries.\nOn Friday, the baker sold 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 pastries.\nOn Saturday, the baker sold 6 + 1 = <<6+1=7>>7 pastries.\nOn Sunday, the baker sold 7 + 1 = <<7+1=8>>8 pastries.\n\nThe total number of pastries sold in the week was 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = <<2+3+4+5+6+7+8=35>>35 pastries.\nSo the average number of pastries sold per day is 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5 pastries.

How much money did she collect during that time?\n\nDuring one day she sells 4 * $8 = $<<4*8=32>>32.\nDuring one week, she sells cakes for 5 * $32 = $<<5*32=160>>160.\nSo during 4 weeks she managed to sell cakes for 4 * $160 = $<<4*160=640>>640.

If the cost of a pack of gummy bears is $2 and a bag of chocolate chips costs $5, how much does 1 chocolate bar cost?\n\nLet x be the cost of one chocolate bar.\nThe cost of the gummy bears is 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 dollars.\nThe cost of the chocolate chips is 5 * 20 = <<5*20=100>>100 dollars.\nThe cost of the chocolate bars is 10 * x = <<10*x=10x>>10x dollars.\nThe total cost is 150 = 20 + 100 + 10x.\nSubtracting 20 + 100 from both sides of the equation, we get 150 - 20 - 100 = 10x\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get 30 = 10x.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get 3 = x\nThus the cost of one chocolate bar is $<<3=x>>3.

If the cost of a pack of gummy bears is $2 and a bag of chocolate chips costs $5, how much does 1 chocolate bar cost?\n\nFirst, calculate the total cost of the gummy bears and chocolate chips: 10 packs * $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20\n20 bags * $5 = $<<20*5=100>>100\nThen, subtract the total cost of the gummy bears and chocolate chips from the total cost to find the total cost of the chocolate bars: $150 - $20 - $100 = $<<150-20-100=30>>30\nFinally, divide the total cost of the chocolate bars by the number of chocolate bars bought to find the cost of one chocolate bar: $30 / 10 chocolate bars = $<<30/10=3>>3.

Anna bought 3 packs of chewing gum for $1.00 each, 5 chocolate bars at $1 each and 2 large candy canes for $0.50 each.  How much money did Anna have left?\n\nAnna bought 3 packs of gum for $1.00 each so that cost 3* $1.00 = $<<3*1=3.00>>3.00\nShe bought 5 chocolate bars at $1.00 each so that cost 5*$1.00 = $<<5*1=5.00>>5.00\nShe bought 2 candy canes for $0.50 each so that cost 2*$0.50 = $<<2*0.50=1.00>>1.00\nTotal spent was $3.00 + $5.00 + $1.00 = $<<3+5+1=9.00>>9.00\nShe was given $10.00 and spent $9.00 so she has $10.00 - $9.00 = $<<10-9=1.00>>1.00.
