How many more minutes can Tina jump rope than Cindy?\n\nCindy can jump rope for 12 minutes.\nBetsy can jump rope for 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 minutes.\nTina can jump rope for 6*3=<<6*3=18>>18 minutes.\nTina can jump for 18-12=<<18-12=6>>6 more minutes than Cindy. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Cindy can run at 3 miles per hour and walk at 1 mile per hour. If she runs for half a mile and then walks for half a mile, how many minutes will it take her to travel the full mile?\n", "text": "Cindy can run at a speed of 3 miles per hour, so it will take her 1/2 / 3 = 0.16666666666666666 hours to run half a mile. In minutes, this is equivalent to 0.16666666666666666 x 60 = 10 minutes. Cindy walks at a speed of 1 mile per hour, so it will take her 1/2 / 1 = 1/2 = 0.5 hours to walk half a mile. In minutes, this is equivalent to 0.5 x 60 = 30 minutes. Therefore, it will take her 10 + 30 = 40 minutes to travel the full mile. Answer: \\boxed{40}."}
