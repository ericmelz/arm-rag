The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?\n\nThe curry house previously bought 30 very spicy curries, which required 3 peppers each, for a total of 30*3 = <<30*3=90>>90 peppers.\nThey also bought 30 spicy curries, which required 2 peppers each, for a total of 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 peppers.\nAnd they bought 10 mild curries, which required 1 pepper each, for a total of 10*1 = <<10*1=10>>10 peppers.\nIn total, they were buying 90+60+10 = <<90+60+10=160>>160 peppers.\nNow, they buy 15 spicy curries, which require 2 peppers each, for a total of 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 peppers.\nAnd they buy 90 mild curries, which require 1 pepper each, for a total of 90*1 = <<90*1=90>>90 peppers.\nIn total, they now buy 30+90 = <<30+90=120>>120 peppers.\nTherefore, the curry house now buys 160-120 = <<160-120=40>>40 fewer peppers. Answer: \\boxed{40}.\n\n\nQuestion: A curry house sells curries that have varying levels of spice. Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?\n\nPreviously, the curry house was buying 30 very spicy curries * 3 peppers = <<30*3=90>>90 peppers for very spicy curries per week.\nThey were also buying 30 spicy curries * 2 peppers = <<30*2=60>>60 peppers for spicy curries per week.\nThey were buying 10 mild curries * 1 pepper = <<10*1=10>>10 peppers for mild curries per week.\nSo they were buying 90 peppers + 60 peppers + 10 peppers = <<90+60+10=160>>160 peppers in total per week.\nThey now buy 15 spicy curries * 2 peppers = <<15*2=30>>30 peppers for spicy curries per week.\nAnd they now buy 90 mild curries * 1 pepper = <<90*1=90>>90 peppers for mild curries per week.\nSo they now buy 30 peppers + 90 peppers = <<30+90=120>>120 peppers in total per week.\nTherefore, the curry house now buys 160 peppers - 120 peppers = <<160-120=40>>40 fewer peppers per week.
