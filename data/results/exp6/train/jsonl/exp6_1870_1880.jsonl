Calculate the angle of B.\n\nLet C be the angle of C.\nThe total angle sum in a triangle is 180 degrees.\nSo A + B + C = 180 degrees.\nSince A is 60 degrees, we have:\n60 + B + C = 180.\nSubstituting B = 2C, we have:\n60 + 2C + C = 180.\nCombining like terms, we get:\n3C + 60 = 180.\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get:\n3C = 120.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nC = 40.\nTherefore, the angle B is 2C = 2 * 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 degrees.

What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\n\nThe hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the base and height of the triangle are 4 inches and 3 inches respectively. The length of the hypotenuse can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nLength of hypotenuse = sqrt((base)^2 + (height)^2)\nLength of hypotenuse = sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5 inches.\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle can be found by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = base + height + hypotenuse\nPerimeter = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 inches. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\n\nLet the length of the third side be x cm.\nThe perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.\nTherefore, x + 40 + 50 = 160\nCombining like terms, we get x + 90 = 160\nSubtracting 90 from both sides, we get x = 160 - 90\nHence, x = <<70=70>>70 cm.

What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\n\nTo find the perimeter of the right-angle triangle, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angle triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is \u221a(4^2 + 3^2) = \u221a(16 + 9) = \u221a25 = 5 inches.\n\nThe sum of the lengths of all three sides is 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 inches.\n\nTherefore, the length of the perimeter of the triangle is 12 inches.

How many twigs will the bird still need to find to finish its nest?\n\nThe bird wants the circle to be 1/7 filled with twigs because 1 x 7 equals <<1/7=1/7>>1.\nIt wants to weave in six for each circle twig because 6 divided by 1 = <<6/1=6>>6.\nThe circle is built from 12 twigs because the factors of 6 with the lowest sum, 1 and 6, must also be multiplied.\nThe bird needs 72 twigs because 12 times 6 equals <<12*6=72>>72\nThe tree has dropped 24 twigs because 72 divided by 3 equals <<72/3=24>>24.\nThe bird needs to find 48 more twigs because 72 minus 24 equals <<72-24=48>>48.

If Carl's insurance company will pay 80% of the costs, leaving Carl to pay the remaining 20%, how much does Carl personally owe?\n\nThe total cost of the car accident is $40,000 + $70,000 = $<<40000+70000=110000>>110,000.\nCarl's insurance will cover 80% of this amount, which is 80/100 * $110,000 = $<<80/100*110000=88000>>88,000.\nTherefore, Carl has to personally pay the remaining 20%, which is 20/100 * $110,000 = $<<20/100*110000=22000>>22,000. Answer: \\boxed{22,000}.\n\n\nQuestion: Carl is hosting an open house for his new business.  He knows 50 people will show up and hopes that another 40 people will randomly show up.

Curious, Benjamin starts to count how many they see. In the first hour once he starts counting he counts 17 billboards. In the second hour once he starts counting he sees 20 billboards. In the third hour he sees 23 billboards. James asks Benjamin the average number of billboards they've seen per hour.

James asks Benjamin the average number of billboards they've seen per hour. What should Benjamin tell him?\n\nTo find the average number of billboards, Benjamin needs to add up the number of billboards seen in each hour and divide by the total number of hours. Benjamin has counted 17 billboards in the first hour, 20 in the second hour, and 23 in the third hour. The total is 17 + 20 + 23 = <<17+20+23=60>>60 billboards. They have driven for 3 hours.

The second artifact takes 3 times as long for the research and discovery.  How long did it take him to find both?\n\nThe research took 6/12=<<6/12=.5>>.5 years\nSo the first artifact took 2+.5=<<2.5=2.5>>2.5 years\nThat means the second artifact took 2.5*3=<<2.5*3=7.5>>7.5 years\nSo in total, it took 2.5+7.5=<<2.5+7.5=10>>10 years.

Ellie says that every time they were in the room with tall mirrors, she saw her reflection 6 times and every time they were in the room with wide mirrors she saw her reflection 3 times. They both passed through the room with tall mirrors 3 times each and they both passed through the room with wide mirrors 5 times each. In total, how many times did Sarah and Ellie see their reflections?\n\nIn the room with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection 10 times each time they passed through a total of 3 times for a total of 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 reflections.\nIn the room with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection 5 times each time they passed through a total of 5 times for a total of 5 * 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 reflections.\nIn the room with tall mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection 6 times each time they passed through a total of 3 times for a total of 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 reflections.\nIn the room with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection 3 times each time they passed through a total of 5 times for a total of 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 reflections.\nAll together, they saw 30 + 25 + 18 + 15 = <<30+25+18+15=88>>88 reflections.
