Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If he was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment?\n", "text": "Two hours is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.\nLeo finished the first part in 25 minutes + the second part that took 25 x 2 = 50 minutes.\nSo Leo spent a total of 25 + 50 = 75 minutes for the 1st and 2nd parts.\nThis means that Leo spent 120 - 75 = 45 minutes to finish the third part of his assignment. Answer: \\boxed{45}."}
