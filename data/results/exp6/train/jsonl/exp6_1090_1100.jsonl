If he ate half of the remaining cookies, how many cookies did they not eat?\n\nJavier's wife ate 30/100*200 = <<30/100*200=60>>60 of the cookies.\nSo there were 200-60 = <<200-60=140>>140 cookies remaining.\nIf Javier's daughter also took some cookies, they were left with 140-40 = <<140-40=100>>100 cookies after the daughter took some.\nThen Javier took half of the remaining number of cookies, which is 1/2*100 = <<1/2*100=50>>50 cookies.\nThe total cookies that were not eaten are 100-50= <<100-50=50>>50. Answer: \\boxed{50}.\n\n\nQuestion: Cristian has 50 more black cookies in his cookie jar than white cookies. He eats half of the black cookies and 3/4 of the white cookies. If he initially had 80 white cookies, how many cookies are remaining within the cookie jar altogether?\n\nIf Cristian had 80 white cookies and eats 3/4 of them, he ate 3/4*80 = <<3/4*80=60>>60 white cookies.\nCristian remains with 80-60 = <<80-60=20>>20 white cookies.\nCristian also had 50 more black cookies in the jar initially than white cookies, a total of 80+50 = <<50+80=130>>130 black cookies.\nWhen he eats half of the black cookies, the number of black cookies reduces to 1/2*130 = <<1/2*130=65>>65 black cookies.\nThe total number of cookies remaining in the jar altogether is 65+20 = <<65+20=85>>85. Answer: \\boxed{85}.\n\n\nQuestion: Out of the 200 cookies that Javier baked from the recipe he learned online, his wife took 30%, and his daughter took 40 from the remaining cookies.
