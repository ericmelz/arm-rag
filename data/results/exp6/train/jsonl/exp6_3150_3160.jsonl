He has $200 + $150 = $350 saved. \n\nNext, we need to determine how much more money Percy needs to reach his goal. The PlayStation costs $500, so Percy needs $500 - $350 = $150 more dollars. \n\nSince each game sold will give Percy $7.5, we divide the amount of money he needs by the price of each game to find the number of games he needs to sell.

He wants to take 40 hour-long lessons before his test, and decides to have two-hour sessions twice a week until he has done his test. After 6 weeks, how many more weeks will Rex need to continue taking lessons to reach his goal?\n\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so Rex will take 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours of lessons per week\nAfter 6 weeks, Rex will have taken a total of 4 h * 6 = <<4*6=24>>24 hours of lessons\nRex wants to take 40 hours \u2013 24 hours= <<40-24=16>>16 hours more\nThus, Rex will need to continue taking lessons for another 16 hours / 4 hours/week = <<16/4=4>>4 weeks.

If he ends up spending only three-quarters of this time reading, and he reads a page every fifteen minutes, how many pages did he read in this time?\n\nRob initially planned to read for three hours, which is equal to 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.\nHowever, he ended up reading only 3/4 * 180 = <<3/4*180=135>>135 minutes.\nIf he reads a page every 15 minutes, Rob would be able to read a total of 135 / 15 = <<135/15=9>>9 pages.
