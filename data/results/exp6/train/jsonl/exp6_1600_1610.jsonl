How much water is left in the bottle (in liters)?\n\nIn the first round of drinking from the bottle, Kimberly drank 4 / 4 = <<4/4=1>>1 liter of water.\nThe water left in the bottle is 4 - 1 = <<4-1=3>>3 liters.\nAfter the second round of drinking, Kimberly consumed 2 / 3 * 3 = <<2/3*3=2>>2 liters.\nThe water left in the bottle is 3 - 2 = <<3-2=1>>1 liter.

Later on, she drank 2/3rd of the remaining water. How much water is left in the bottle (in liters)?\n\nThe first time she drank from the bottle, she consumed 1/4*4 = <<1/4*4=1>>1 liter of water.\nThis means that she had 4-1 = <<4-1=3>>3 liters of water left in the bottle.\nAfter drinking 2/3 of the remaining water, she consumed 2/3*3 = <<2/3*3=2>>2 liters of water.\nThe total amount of water left in the bottle is 3-2 = <<3-2=1>>1 liter.
