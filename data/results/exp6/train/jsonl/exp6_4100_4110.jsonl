The checkpoints have equal spacing between them. How many miles apart are each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line?\n\nThe marathon is 26 miles long and there are 4 checkpoints, including the start and finish lines, so there are 26 - 1 - 1 = <<26-1-1=24>>24 miles between the first and last checkpoints.\nTherefore, there are 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 miles between each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line.

If the average completion time of the last three students was 35 seconds, and the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, how long (in seconds) did it take the student who came first to finish the race?\n\nLet's call the completion time of the first student x. \n\nThe total completion time for all four runners is 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 seconds. \n\nThe total completion time for the last three students is 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 seconds. \n\nSo the completion time of the first student is 120 - 105 - x = <<120-105-x=15-x>>15 - x.\n\nSince the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, we have the equation (105 + x) / 4 = 30.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 gives 105 + x = 120.\n\nSubtracting 105 from both sides gives x = 120 - 105 = <<120-105=15>>15.\n\nTherefore, it took the student who came first 15 seconds to finish the race.

To find the distance between each consecutive checkpoint, we need to subtract the distances of the first and last checkpoints from the total distance of the marathon.\n\nThe total distance of the marathon is 26 miles. However, since the first checkpoint is one mile from the start line and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line, we need to subtract 1 mile from the total distance: 26 - 1 - 1 = 24 miles.\n\nNow, we divide the total distance between the first and last checkpoints by the number of checkpoints (4) to find the distance between each consecutive checkpoint: 24 / 4 = 6 miles.\n\nTherefore, each consecutive checkpoint between the start-finish line is 6 miles apart.

If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?\n\nUnder optimal wind conditions, Buffy's sailboat travels at a speed of 25 knots per hour with one sail. To convert this to land miles per hour, we multiply by 1.15 since one knot is equal to 1.15 land miles. Therefore, 25 knots/hour * 1.15 land miles/knot = <<25*1.15=28.75>>28.75 land miles per hour.\nIn 4 hours, Buffy travels a total distance of 4 hours * 28.75 land miles per hour = <<4*28.75=115>>115 land miles using one sail.\nUnder optimal wind conditions, Buffy's sailboat travels at a speed of 50 knots per hour with two sails. To convert this to land miles per hour, we multiply by 1.15 since one knot is equal to 1.15 land miles. Therefore, 50 knots/hour * 1.15 land miles/knot = <<50*1.15=57.5>>57.5 land miles per hour.\nIn 4 hours, Buffy travels a total distance of 4 hours * 57.5 land miles per hour = <<4*57.5=230>>230 land miles using two sails.\nTherefore, the total distance Buffy will travel is 115 land miles + 230 land miles = <<115+230=345>>345 land miles.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?\n\nThe first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, which is equal to 1.5 hours.\nThe second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, so it is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 hours long.\nSo the total movie time is 1.5 + 2 = <<1.5+2=3.5>>3.5 hours.\nThey spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries, which is 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.\nSo the total cooking time is 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes.\nTherefore, it took them a total of 3.5 + 0.5 = <<3.5+0.5=4>>4 hours to cook and watch the movies.

First, he wants to make a To Do list and count up how many things he has to do that day and how long it should take. He has several items under 'clean the house,' 'take a shower' and then 'make dinner.' In total there are 7 things to do to clean the house; 1 thing to do to take a shower; and 4 things to do to make dinner. If everything on Trey's list takes 10 minutes to do, how many hours total will it take to complete Trey's list?\n\nTrey has 7 things on his 'clean the house' list + 1 thing on his 'take a shower' list + 4 things on his 'make dinner' list = <<7+1+4=12>>12 things to do in total.\nIf each thing on Trey's list takes 10 minutes to complete, then it will take him a total of 12 things * 10 minutes per thing = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes to complete his list.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, it will take Trey a total of 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = <<120/60=2>>2 hours to complete his list.

How many miles does he run?\n\nHe watches movies for 1.5 * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 hours.\nHe runs for 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.\nHe runs 180 / 12 = <<180/12=15>>15 miles. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: While Paul watches movies, he runs on his treadmill. He can run a mile in 12 minutes. He watches two movies, which are an average length of 1.5 hours. How many miles does he run?\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, the movies are 1.5 x 60 = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes long each.\nSo, the total amount of time he spent watching them is 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 minutes.\nThus, he can run for 180/12 = <<180/12=15>>15 miles.

If everything on Trey's list takes 10 minutes to do, how many hours total will it take to complete Trey's list?\n\nFirst find the total number of things on Trey's to-do list: 7 things + 1 thing + 4 things = <<7+1+4=12>>12 things\nThen multiply the number of things on the list by the time it takes to do each thing to find the total time: 12 things * 10 minutes/thing = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes\nThen divide the total time in minutes by the number of minutes per hour to find the total time in hours: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<120/60=2>>2 hours.

He wouldn't be home until 5 pm because of baseball practice.  He knew dinner would take 45 minutes, and he figured his homework would take 30 minutes to finish.  He needed to clean his room, which would take 30 minutes; then take out the trash, which would take about 5 minutes; and empty the dishwasher,  which would take another 10 minutes.  What was the latest time that Justin could start his chores and homework to be done by 8 pm to watch his movie?\n", "text": "To find the latest time that Justin could start his chores and homework, we need to add up the time it takes for each task and subtract that from 8 pm.\n\nJustin has baseball practice until 5 pm, so he has 3 hours (8 pm - 5 pm) to complete his chores and homework.\n\nDinner will take 45 minutes, homework will take 30 minutes, cleaning his room will take 30 minutes, taking out the trash will take 5 minutes, and emptying the dishwasher will take 10 minutes. \n\nThe total time for these tasks is 45 + 30 + 30 + 5 + 10 = 120 minutes, or 2 hours.\n\nSince Justin has 3 hours to complete these tasks and it will take him 2 hours, he could start his chores and homework at 8 pm - 2 hours = 6 pm.\n\nTherefore, the latest time that Justin could start his chores and homework is 6 pm.
