He travels uphill at 2 MPH and downhill at 3MPH. The trail is 5 miles long. 60% is uphill and the rest is downhill. How long does it take him to complete it in minutes?\n\nFirst find how many miles of the trail are uphill: 5 miles * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 miles\nThen find how long it takes to travel uphill: 3 miles / 2 MPH = <<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours\nThen find how many miles of the trail are downhill: 5 miles - 3 miles = <<5-3=2>>2 miles\nThen find how long it takes to travel downhill: 2 miles / 3 MPH = 2/3 hours\nThen convert that time to minutes: 2/3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2/3*60=40>>40 minutes\nThen convert the uphill time to minutes: 1.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes\nThen add the uphill and downhill times to find the total time: 90 minutes + 40 minutes = <<90+40=130>>130 minutes.

If Roberto's starting salary was $80,000, what is his current salary?\n\nRoberto's salary after receiving a 40% raise from his starting salary is 80000 + 80000*40/100 = $<<80000+80000*40/100=112000>>112,000\nRoberto received a 20% raise, so his current salary is 112000 + 112000*20/100 = $<<112000+112000*20/100=134400>>134,400.

If Roberto's starting salary was $80,000, what is his current salary?\n\nRoberto's previous salary was 40/100 * 80,000 = $<<40/100*80000=32000>>32,000 more than his starting salary.\nSo, his previous salary was 80,000 + 32,000 = $<<80000+32000=112000>>112,000.\nRoberto received a 20/100 * 112,000 = $<<20/100*112000=22400>>22,400 raise.\nTherefore, Roberto's current salary is 112,000 + 22,400 = $<<112000+22400=134400>>134,400.

If Roberto's starting salary was $80,000, what is his current salary?\n\nRoberto's starting salary was $80,000 and his previous salary was already 40% higher, so his previous salary was 1.4*$80,000 = $<<80000*1.4=112000>>112,000.\nThus, Roberto's current salary is $112,000 + $112,000*0.2 = $112,000 + $22,400 = $<<112000+22400=134400>>134,400.

If Roberto's starting salary was $80,000, what is his current salary?\n\nRoberto's starting salary was $80,000, so his previous salary (40% higher) was $80,000 + $80,000 * 40% = $80,000 + $32,000 = $<<80000+80000*40*.01=112000>>112,000.\nHis current salary after a 20% raise is $112,000 + $112,000 * 20% = $112,000 + $22,400 = $<<112000+112000*20*.01=134400>>134,400.
