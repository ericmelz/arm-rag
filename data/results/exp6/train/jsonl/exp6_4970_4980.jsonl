How many seeds can Bob plant in each row?\n\nFirst convert the length of the rows to inches: 120 feet * 12 inches/foot = <<120*12=1440>>1440 inches\nThen divide the length of the row in inches by the space each seed takes up: 1440 inches / 18 inches/seed = <<1440/18=80>>80 seeds. Answer: \\boxed{80}.\n\n\nQuestion: Cary is an engineer in charge of designing an irrigation system for three farmers. Farmer Bob grows 3 acres of corn, 9 acres of cotton, and 12 acres of beans. Farmer Brenda grows 6 acres of corn, 7 acres of cotton, and 14 acres of beans. Farmer Bernie grows 2 acres of corn and 12 acres of cotton. If corn takes 20 gallons of water an acre, cotton takes 80 gallons of water an acre, and beans take twice as much water as corn, what percentage of the total water used will go to Farmer Bob's farm?\n\nFirst find the total water Bob's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 3 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<3*20=60>>60 gallons\nThen find the total water Bob's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 9 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<9*80=720>>720 gallons\nThen find the total water Bob's beans will use by multiplying the beans' water use per acre by the number of acres: 12 acres * 2 * 20 gallons/acre = <<12*2*20=480>>480 gallons\nThen add all three amounts of water used to find the total: 60 gallons + 720 gallons + 480 gallons = <<60+720+480=1260>>1260 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 6 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<6*20=120>>120 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 7 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<7*80=560>>560 gallons\nThen find the total water Brenda's beans will use by multiplying the beans' water use per acre by the number of acres: 14 acres * 2 * 20 gallons/acre = <<14*2*20=560>>560 gallons\nThen add all three amounts of water used to find the total: 120 gallons + 560 gallons + 560 gallons = <<120+560+560=1240>>1240 gallons\nThen find the total water Bernie's corn will use by multiplying the corn's water use per acre by the number of acres: 2 acres * 20 gallons/acre = <<2*20=40>>40 gallons\nThen find the total water Bernie's cotton will use by multiplying the cotton's water use per acre by the number of acres: 12 acres * 80 gallons/acre = <<12*80=960>>960 gallons\nThen add both amounts of water to find the total: 40 gallons + 960 gallons = <<40+960=1000>>1000 gallons\nThen add the totals from all three farmers to find the overall total water used: 1000 gallons + 1240 gallons + 1260 gallons = <<1000+1240+1260=3500>>3500 gallons\nThen divide the amount of water Bob uses by the total water used and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1260 gallons / 3500 gallons * 100% = 36%.
