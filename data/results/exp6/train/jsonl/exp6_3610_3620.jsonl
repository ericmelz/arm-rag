If the other players continue their average over the next 6 games, how many hits will each player average across the 6 games in total?\n", "text": "The first 5 games have a total of 75 hits because 5 times 15 equals <<5*15=75>>75.\nThe other 10 players on the team have managed 50 hits because 75 minus 25 equals <<75-25=50>>50.\nThe other 10 players average 5 hits per game because 50 divided by 10 equals <<50/10=5>>5.\nThe entire team averages 10 hits per game because 15 minus 5 equals <<15-5=10>>10.\nThe other 10 players average one hit per game because 5 divided by 5 equals <<5/5=1>>1.\nEach player will average 6 across the 6 games in total because 6 times 1 equals 6.
