If she realizes a $120 profit on her sales, how many people have she sold the books to if each book costs $5 to make and every customer buys 2 at a time?\n\nIf each book costs $5 to make, she earns $20 for each book she sells, so she makes a profit of $20-$5 = $<<20-5=15>>15 for each book.\nSince a profit of $120 was made, this means she sold $120/$15 = <<120/15=8>>8 books.\nSince every customer buys 2 books at a time, this means she sold a book to 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 people. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: An entrepreneur is crowdfunding a new business effort. He has three different dollar amount levels of financial backing options and each level is ten times as high as the previous one. He needs to raise $12000 to get his business off the ground. He succeeded after getting two backers at the highest level of financial backing, three at the second level, and ten at the lowest level. How many dollars was the highest level of financial backing?\n", "text": "Let's call the dollar amount of the lowest level of financial backing x. Since each level is ten times as high as the previous one, the second level is 10x and the highest level is 100x.\nIf there were 10 backers at the lowest level, this means a total of 10x dollars were raised from that level.\nIf there were 3 backers at the second level, this means a total of 3 * 10x = 30x dollars were raised from that level.\nIf there were 2 backers at the highest level, this means a total of 2 * 100x = 200x dollars were raised from that level.\nSo in total, 10x + 30x + 200x = 12000 dollars were raised.\nCombining like terms, we get 240x = 12000.\nDividing both sides by 240, we find x = 50.\nTherefore, the highest level of financial backing was 100x = 100 * 50 = 5000 dollars. Answer: \\boxed{5000}."}
