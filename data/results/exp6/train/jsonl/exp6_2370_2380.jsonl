How much did Tony pay in total?\n\nThe total cost for the Lego blocks is $250 x 3 = $<<250*3=750>>750.\nThe total cost for the toy sword is $120 x 7 = $<<120*7=840>>840.\nThe total cost for the play dough is $35 x 10 = $<<35*10=350>>350.\nTherefore, Tony paid a total of $750 + $840 + $350 = $<<750+840+350=1940>>1940.

Each horse needs twice as much water as a pig, and the chickens drink from one tank that needs 30 gallons. How many gallons of water does Carla need to bring if she has 8 pigs and 10 horses and each pig needs 3 gallons of water?\n\nThe pigs need 8 * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 gallons of water.\nEach horse needs 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 gallons of water.\nThe horses need 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 gallons of water.\nSo Carla needs a total of 24 + 60 + 30 = <<24+60+30=114>>114 gallons of water.

How many gallons of water does Carla need to bring if she has 8 pigs and 10 horses and each pig needs 3 gallons of water?\n\nIf each pig needs 3 gallons of water, Carla needs to bring 8 pigs * 3 gallons/pig = <<8*3=24>>24 gallons of water.\nEach horse needs twice as much water as a pig, which means each horse needs 3 gallons/pig * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 gallons of water.\nTherefore, Carla needs to bring 10 horses * 6 gallons/horse = <<10*6=60>>60 gallons of water.\nAltogether, Carla needs to bring 24 gallons + 60 gallons + 30 gallons = <<24+60+30=114>>114 gallons of water.
