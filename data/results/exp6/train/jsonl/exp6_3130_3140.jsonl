If his friend agrees to kick in $10, how much should Mark add?\n\nThe tip Mark wants to give is 20% of $200, which is $200 * 0.20 = $<<200*0.20=40>>40.\nIf Mark's friend contributes $10, Mark should add $40 - $10 = $<<40-10=30>>30. Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark went to a store where he spent one-half of his money, and then spent $14 more. He then went to another store where he spent one-third of his starting money, and then spent $16 more. If he then had no money left, how much did he have when he entered the first store?\n\nLet X be the amount Mark had when he entered the first store.\nMark spent X/2 + $14 in the first store.\nMark spent X/3 + $16 in the second store.\nMark had X - (X/2 + $14) - (X/3 + $16) = $0 left.\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get X - (X/2 + $14) - (X/3 + $16) = $0.\nCombining like terms, we get X - X/2 - $14 - X/3 - $16 = $0.\nCombining X's, we get (6X - 3X)/6 - (2X - X)/6 - $14 - $16 = $0.\nCombining like terms, we get X/6 - $30 = $0.\nAdding $30 to both sides, we get X/6 = $30.\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get X = $<<180=180>>180. Answer: \\boxed{180}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark went to a store where he spent one-half of his money, and then spent $14 more. He then went to another store where he spent one-third of his starting money, and then spent $16 more. If he then had no money left, how much did he have when he entered the first store?\n\nLet X be the initial amount Mark had.\nMark spent X/2 + 14 at the first store.\nHe had X - (X/2 + 14) = X/2 - 14 left.\nMark spent X/3 + 16 at the second store.\nThus, he had X/2 - 14 - (X/3 + 16) = 0 left.\nThus, X/2 - X/3 = 14 + 16.\nThus, (3X - 2X)/(2 * 3) = 30.\nThus, X/6 = 30.\nThus, X = 180.

He goes to the store to buy balloons and sees that they sell small bags for $4, medium bags for $6 and extra large bags for $12. He has $24 and wants to get the most balloons as possible. If the $4 bags contain 50 balloons, the $6 bags contain 75 balloons and the $12 bags contain 200 balloons, what is the greatest number of balloons he can buy?\n", "text": "The greatest number of balloons Mark can buy is determined by the type of bag that gives him the most balloons for his money. \n\nThe $4 bags give him 50 balloons per bag. He has $24, so he can buy 24 / 4 = 6 $4 bags. This would give him 6 * 50 = 300 balloons.\n\nThe $6 bags give him 75 balloons per bag. He has $24, so he can buy 24 / 6 = 4 $6 bags. This would give him 4 * 75 = 300 balloons.\n\nThe $12 bags give him 200 balloons per bag. He has $24, so he can buy 24 / 12 = 2 $12 bags. This would give him 2 * 200 = 400 balloons.\n\nSince the $12 bags give him the most balloons, Mark can buy a maximum of 400 water balloons. Answer: \\boxed{400}."}
