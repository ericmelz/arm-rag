She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?\n", "text": "To find the total number of sequins Jane adds, we need to calculate the number of blue sequins, purple sequins, and green sequins separately, and then add them up.\n\nFor blue sequins:\nJane sews 6 rows, and each row has 8 sequins. Multiply these two numbers: 6 * 8 = 48.\n\nFor purple sequins:\nJane sews 5 rows, and each row has 12 sequins. Multiply these two numbers: 5 * 12 = 60.\n\nFor green sequins:\nJane sews 9 rows, and each row has 6 sequins. Multiply these two numbers: 9 * 6 = 54.\n\nFinally, add the number of each color sequin to find the total number of sequins: 48 + 60 + 54 = 162.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{162}."}
