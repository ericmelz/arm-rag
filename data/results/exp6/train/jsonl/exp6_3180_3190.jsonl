A sheep standing 160 feet away from the sheep dog bolts, and the dog runs after it. How many seconds does it take the dog to catch the sheep?\n\nThe dog runs at a faster speed than the sheep, so we need to figure out how much faster the dog is. We do this by subtracting the sheep's speed from the dog's speed: 20 ft/s - 12 ft/s = <<20-12=8>>8 ft/s\nTo figure out how long it takes the dog to catch the sheep, we divide the distance between them by the difference in their speeds: 160 ft / 8ft/s = <<160/8=20>>20 s. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mary and Jimmy start running from the same spot, but in opposite directions. Mary runs at 5 miles per hour and Jimmy runs at 4 miles per hour. What is the distance between them after 1 hour?\n\nIn one hour, Mary will have traveled 5 miles (5 mph x 1 hour) and Jimmy will have traveled 4 miles (4 mph x 1 hour). Since they are running in opposite directions, the distance between them is the sum of their distances: 5 miles + 4 miles = <<5+4=9>>9 miles.

If John and his dog go on a run together for 30 minutes, and then John runs for an additional 30 minutes by himself, how far will John have traveled?\n\nJohn is propelled at a speed of 6 miles per hour, which is an additional 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 miles per hour.\nThus, John and his German Shepherd dog travel 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 miles in the first 30 minutes.\nIn the next 30 minutes, running at 4 miles per hour, John will cover 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles.\nTherefore, in total, John will travel 3+2=<<3+2=5>>5 miles.
