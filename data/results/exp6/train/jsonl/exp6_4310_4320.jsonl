On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\n\nLet's assume the number of students present in the class on the first day was x.\nThe number of students present in the class on the second day was x+40.\n\nThe number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day is twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day.\nIf 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick on the third day, then the number of students who didn't attend the class on the third day is 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40\n\nIf the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day is 40, then the number of students who didn't turn up on the second day is twice that number, or 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80.\n\nIn both of the two days, the total number of absentees is 40+80 = <<40+80=120>>120\nThe total number of students present on the first and second days is x+(x+40) = 2x+40\nSince the total number of students in the class is 280, the number of students present on the first and second days is 2x+40 = 280\n\nFrom the equation, 2x+40 = 280, the value of x is 280-40/2 = 240/2 = <<240/2=120>>120\nThe number of students absent on the first day is x, which is 120.\n\nThe total number of absentees in the three days is 120+120 = <<120+120=240>>240. Answer: \\boxed{240}.\n\n\nQuestion: Ten percent less than twice the total number of students present in the science class yesterday have attended class today.
