Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\n\nTo determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs, we first need to add up the total distance Terese runs throughout the week: 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = <<4.2+3.8+3.6+4.4=16>>16 miles\nNext, we divide the total distance (16 miles) by the number of days Terese runs (4) to find the average distance: 16 miles / 4 days = <<16/4=4>>4 miles.

On Monday, she runs 4.2 miles;  Tuesday, 3.8 miles; Wednesday, 3.6 miles; and on Thursday, 4.4 miles.  Determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs.\n\nTo determine the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs, we need to add up all the distances she runs and divide by the number of days she runs.\n\nTotal distance Terese runs = 4.2 + 3.8 + 3.6 + 4.4 = <<4.2+3.8+3.6+4.4=16>>16 miles\n\nNumber of days Terese runs = 4\n\nAverage distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs = Total distance Terese runs / Number of days Terese runs = 16 / 4 = <<16/4=4>>4 miles\n\nTherefore, the average distance Terese runs on each of the days she runs is 4 miles.
