Answer: \\boxed{44}.\n\n\nQuestion: Andrew bought 750 stickers. He shared some of his stickers with his friends, Daniel and Fred.  Daniel received 250 stickers, while Fred received 120 more stickers than Daniel.   He kept the remaining stickers. How many stickers did Andrew keep?\n\nAfter sharing some of his stickers, Andrew remained with 750 - 250 - (250 + 120) = <<750-250-(250+120)=130>>130 stickers.

It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\n\nThe hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the base and height of the triangle are 4 inches and 3 inches respectively. The length of the hypotenuse can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nLength of hypotenuse = sqrt((base)^2 + (height)^2)\nLength of hypotenuse = sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5 inches.\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle can be found by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = base + height + hypotenuse\nPerimeter = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 inches. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\n\nLet the length of the third side be x cm.\nThe perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.\nTherefore, x + 40 + 50 = 160\nCombining like terms, we get x + 90 = 160\nSubtracting 90 from both sides, we get x = 160 - 90\nHence, x = <<70=70>>70 cm.

What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: hypotenuse = \u221a(base^2 + height^2) = \u221a(4^2 + 3^2) = \u221a(16 + 9) = \u221a25 = 5 inches.\nThe perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all three sides: 4 + 3 + 5 = <<4+3+5=12>>12 inches.

What is the base length of a triangle with height 8 and area 24 square units?\n", "text": "The formula for the area of a triangle is given as 1/2*base*height.\n\nLet the base length of the triangle be x units.\nGiven the height of the triangle is 8 units and the area is 24 square units, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n1/2 * x * 8 = 24\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\nx * 8 = 48\n\nDividing both sides by 8 gives:\nx = 48 / 8\n\nTherefore, the base length of the triangle is 6 units.
