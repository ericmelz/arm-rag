How many sweets were on the table at first?\n\nLet's say there were x sweets on the table at first.\nAfter Jack took half of the candies and 4 more, he took (1/2)x + 4 candies.\nSo the remaining candies on the table were x - [(1/2)x + 4] = (1/2)x - 4.\nPaul then took the remaining 7 sweets, so (1/2)x - 4 = 7.\nAdding 4 to both sides of the equation gives (1/2)x = 11.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2 gives x = 22.\nTherefore, there were 22 sweets on the table originally. Answer: \\boxed{22}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark has 30 candies, Peter has 25 candies, and John has 35 candies. They decided to combine their candies together and share them equally. How many candies will each one of them have?\n\nThey have a total of 30 + 25 + 35 = <<30+25+35=90>>90 candies.\nSo each one of them will have 90/3 = <<90/3=30>>30 candies.
