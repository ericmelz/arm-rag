Matt got twice as many apples, and Mark got as many bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether. How many fruits do the three children have in total?\n\nIf Mike received 3 oranges, the total number of oranges is 3 oranges.\nMatt got twice as many apples, a total of 2 * 3 oranges = <<2*3=6>>6 apples.\nThe total number of fruits that Mike and Matt got is 6 apples + 3 oranges = <<6+3=9>>9 fruits.\nMark received the same number of bananas as Mike and Matt received fruits altogether, so he got 9 fruits.\nIn total, the three children have 9 fruits + 9 fruits = <<9+9=18>>18 fruits.
