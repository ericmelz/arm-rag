How many fish will he have in five years?\n\nIn the first year, Tony has 2 + 2 - 1 = <<2+2-1=3>>3 fish.\nIn the second year, he has 3 + 2 - 1 = <<3+2-1=4>>4 fish.\nIn the third year, he has 4 + 2 - 1 = <<4+2-1=5>>5 fish.\nIn the fourth year, he has 5 + 2 - 1 = <<5+2-1=6>>6 fish.\nIn the fifth year, he has 6 + 2 - 1 = <<6+2-1=7>>7 fish. Answer: \\boxed{7}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies. How many fish will he have in five years?\n\nEach year, Tony's number of fish increases by 2, but one of them dies. Therefore, the number of fish effectively increases by 1 each year. After five years, he will have 5 * 1 = <<5*1=5>>5 extra fish.\nHowever, since he already has two fish to start with, he will actually have 2 + 5 = <<2+5=7>>7 fish. Answer: \\boxed{7}.\n\n\nQuestion: Bobby has an aquarium with twice as many fish as Sarah's has.  Sarah has 5 more fish in her aquarium than Tony does.  Tony has 3 times as many fish in his aquarium as Billy does.  Billy has 10 fish.  How many fish do all 4 people have put together?\n\nTony has 3 times as many as Billy, who has 10 fish so Tony has 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 fish\nSarah has 5 more fish than Tony who has 30 so she has 30+5 = <<30+5=35>>35 fish\nBobby has twice as many fish as Sarah who has 35 fish so he has 2*35 = <<2*35=70>>70 fish\nTogether they have 10+30+35+70 = <<10+30+35+70=145>>145 fish.

He did a warm-up puzzle that only took 10 minutes and after that he did 2 puzzles that each took 3 times as long.  How long did he spend solving puzzles?\n\nThe two puzzles took 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 minutes each\nSo they took 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 minutes\nSo he spent 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 minutes solving puzzles.

How many more pages should she read per day to actually achieve her goal?\n\nAccording to Jessy's initial plan, she would read 3 times daily * 6 pages each time = <<3*6=18>>18 pages per day.\nTo reach her goal, she needs to read the entire book, so that's 140 pages / 7 days = <<140/7=20>>20 pages per day.\nTherefore, Jessy should read an additional 20 pages per day - 18 pages per day = <<20-18=2>>2 more pages per day.

If his destination is 280 miles away and his motorcycle consumes 8 liters of gasoline per 40 miles, how many times does Keanu have to refill his motorcycle with gasoline if he will make a round trip?\n\nIn one round trip, Keanu will travel 280 x 2 = <<280*2=560>>560 miles.\nIf his motorcycle consumes 8 liters of gasoline per 40 miles, then it consumes 560/40 = <<560/40=14>>14 sets of 8 liters of gasoline.\nTherefore, Keanu has to refill his motorcycle 14 times with gasoline. Answer: \\boxed{14}.\n\n\nQuestion: Keanu was surfing towards the shore at a speed of 20 miles per hour.  A shark was swimming alongside him, riding the same wave, when it doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu.  There was a pilot fish swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, and when the shark increased its speed, the pilot fish also increased its speed and moved away from Keanu, but only increasing its speed by half as much as the shark had increased its speed by.  What speed, in miles per hour, was the pilot fish swimming when it moved away from Keanu?\n\nThe shark doubled its speed from 20 miles per hour to 2*20=<<20*2=40>>40 miles per hour.\nThus, the shark increased its speed by 40-20=<<40-20=20>>20 miles per hour.\nTherefore, the pilot fish increased its speed by 1/2*20=<<1/2*20=10>>10 miles per hour.\nThis means that the pilot fish was swimming at a speed of 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30 miles per hour when it moved away from Keanu.
