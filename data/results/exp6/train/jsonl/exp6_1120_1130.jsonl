How many gilled mushrooms were on the fallen log\u2019s side?\n\nLet G be the number of gilled mushrooms and S be the number of spotted mushrooms on the log\u2019s side. We know that G + S = 30, as there are 30 mushrooms growing. We also know that G = (1/9)S, as only one out of every nine mushrooms is gilled. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get (1/9)S + S = 30\nCombining like terms, we get (10/9)S = 30\nDividing both sides by (10/9), we get S = (9/10)*30\nS = 27\nSubstituting this value back into G = (1/9)S, we get G = (1/9)*27 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log\u2019s side. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: A certain kind of wild mushroom has either spots or gills, but never both. Gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow. A fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side. How many gilled mushrooms were on the fallen log\u2019s side?\n\nLet G be the number of gilled mushrooms and S be the number of spotted mushrooms. We know that G + S = 30 and G = S / 9.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get S / 9 + S = 30\nCombining like terms, we get S + 9S = 270\nCombining like terms again, we get 10S = 270\nDividing both sides by 10, we get S = <<27=27>>27\nSubstituting this value back into G = S / 9, we get G = 27 / 9 = <<27/9=3>>3. Answer: \\boxed{3}.\n\n\nQuestion: A certain kind of wild mushroom has either spots or gills, but never both. Gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow. A fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side. How many gilled mushrooms were on the fallen log\u2019s side?\n\nLet\u2019s start by determining the ratio of spotted mushrooms to gilled mushrooms. For every 9 spotted mushrooms, there is 1 gilled mushroom, so the ratio is 9:1.\nNow, we need to divide the total number of mushrooms by the sum of the parts of the ratio. In this case, the total number of mushrooms is 30, and the sum of the parts of the ratio is 9+1=10.\nDividing 30 by 10 gives us 30/10= <<30/10=3>>3 groups of 10 mushrooms.\nSince each group consists of 1 gilled mushroom and 9 spotted mushrooms, there are a total of 3*1= <<3*1=3>>3 gilled mushrooms on the log\u2019s side.

We know that G + S = 30, and for every 9 spotted mushrooms, there is 1 gilled mushroom. \nWe can divide the number of spotted mushrooms by 9 to find the number of groups of 9 spotted mushrooms. In this case, S/9 = G. \nIf we substitute this value into the equation G + S = 30, we get S/9 + S = 30. \nCombining like terms, we get (10/9)S = 30. \nDividing both sides by (10/9), we get S = (9/10)*30 = 27. \nSubstituting this value back into G = S/9, we get G = 27/9 = 3. \nTherefore, there are 3 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log's side.
