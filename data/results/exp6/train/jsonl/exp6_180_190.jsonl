The number of cases increased by 500 on the second day, with 50 recoveries. On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries. What's the total number of positive cases after the third day?\n\nOn the second day, the total number of cases increased by 500, meaning there were 2000 + 500 = <<2000+500=2500>>2500 positive cases after the second day.\nSince there were also 50 recoveries on the second day, the total number of cases after the second day became 2500 - 50 = <<2500-50=2450>>2450\nThe total number of cases after the third day became 2450 + 1500 = <<2450+1500=3950>>3950\nSince there were also 200 recoveries during the third day, the total number of COVID cases after the third day became 3950 - 200 = <<3950-200=3750>>3750.

If the two snakes have a combined length of 70 inches, how long is Jake's snake?\n\nLet x be the length of Jenny's snake.\nJake's snake is x + 12 inches long.\nThe total length of the two snakes is  x + (x + 12) = 70 inches\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 12 = 70\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 58\ndividing both sides by 2, we get x = 29 inches\nJake's snake is therefore 12 inches longer than Jenny's, or 29 + 12 = <<29+12=41>>41 inches.
