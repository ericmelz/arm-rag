Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n\nLet's assume that the first ship had x number of people on it.\nAccording to the problem, the second ship had twice as many people as the first ship, so it had 2x people on it.\nSimilarly, the third ship had twice as many people as the second ship, so it had 4x people on it.\nIn general, we can say that the nth ship had 2^(n-1)x people on it.\nOver three hundred years, the sum of people eaten by the monster is 847 people.\nSo, we can write it as: x + 2x + 4x + ... + 2^(n-1)x = 847\nThis is a geometric series, and we can calculate its sum using the formula:\nSum = (first term * (1 - r^n)) / (1 - r), where r is the common ratio.\nIn this case, the common ratio is 2 (as each ship has twice as many people as the previous one), and we want to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\nSo, the equation becomes: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (1 - 2) = 847\nSimplifying further, we get: (x * (1 - 2^n)) / (-1) = 847\nOr, x * (2^n - 1) = 847\nLet's solve this equation for n = 3 (as we know the sum of people eaten is 847).\nx * (2^3 - 1) = 847\nx * 7 = 847\nx = 847 / 7\nx = 121\nTherefore, there were 121 people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years.
