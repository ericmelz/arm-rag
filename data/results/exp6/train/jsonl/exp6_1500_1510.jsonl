How much weight, in pounds, is left on the truck after the two deliveries?\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much weight is removed at the first store. To do this, multiply the original weight by the percentage as a decimal: 50000 pounds * .10 = <<50000*.10=5000>>5000 pounds\nNow we need to calculate how much weight remains on the truck after the first delivery by subtracting the weight unloaded at the first store: 50000 pounds - 5000 pounds = <<50000-5000=45000>>45000 pounds\nWe now need to calculate how much weight is removed at the second store. To do this, multiply the remaining weight by the percentage as a decimal: 45000 pounds * .20 = <<45000*.20=9000>>9000 pounds\nNow we need to calculate how much weight remains on the truck after the second delivery by subtracting the weight unloaded at the second store: 45000 pounds - 9000 pounds = <<45000-9000=36000>>36000 pounds.
