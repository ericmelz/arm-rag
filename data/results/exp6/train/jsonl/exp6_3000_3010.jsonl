It got cut in a way that left it 30% shorter. How long is the pole?\n\nThe pole is initially 20 meters long.\nIf it got cut 30% shorter, we need to find 30% of 20 meters.\n30% of 20 meters is (30/100)*20 = 6 meters.\nTherefore, the pole is now 20 meters - 6 meters = <<20-6=14>>14 meters.

How long is the pole?\n\nThe pole got cut by 30%, which means it is now 100% - 30% = 70% of its original length.\nTherefore, the length of the pole now is 70/100 * 20 = <<70/100*20=14>>14 meters.

How long is the pole?\n\nTo find the length of the pole after it got cut, first, we need to calculate the amount that was cut off. \n\n30% of 20 meters is (30/100) * 20 = <<30/100*20=6>>6 meters.\n\nTherefore, the pole is now 20 - 6 = <<20-6=14>>14 meters long. Answer: \\boxed{14}.\n\n\nQuestion: A pole is 20 meters long. It got cut in a way that left it 30% shorter. How long is the pole?\n\nIf the pole got cut 30% shorter, the remaining length would be 100% - 30% = 70% of the original length.\n70% of 20 meters is (70/100) * 20 = <<(70/100)*20=14>>14 meters.

How many more flavors will she need to try this year to have tried all 100 flavors?\n", "text": "Gretchen tried 1/4 * 100 = 25 flavors two years ago.\nLast year, she doubled that amount and tried 25 * 2 = 50 flavors.\nSo far, she has tried a total of 25 + 50 = 75 flavors.\nTo try all 100 flavors, she still needs to try 100 - 75 = 25 more flavors.

How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\n\nLet X be the price of each skirt.\nEmily paid 2*X for the skirts.\nShe paid 2*X + 20 = 50 dollars.\nThus 2*X = 50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30 dollars.\nAnd the price for each skirt is X = 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 dollars. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20 and 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money. She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\n\nLet's represent the cost of each skirt as \"x\".\n\nThe total amount spent by Emily is $50, which is equal to the cost of art supplies + the cost of 2 skirts.\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n20 + 2x = 50.\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides of the equation, we have:\n\n2x = 50 - 20,\n2x = 30.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:\n\nx = 30/2,\nx = 15.\n\nTherefore, Emily paid $15 for each of the skirts. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Emily bought a shirt and a coat for $600. What does the shirt cost if it is one-third the price of the coat?\n\nLet X be the price of the coat.\nThe price of the shirt is X/3.\nX + X/3 = $600.\nMultiply through the equation by 3 to remove the fraction: X + X/3 * 3 = $600 * 3\n3X + X = $1800.\n4X = $1800.\nX = $1800 / 4 = $<<1800/4=450>>450.\nThe price of the shirt is X/3 = $450 / 3 = $<<450/3=150>>150. Answer: \\boxed{150}.\n\n\nQuestion: Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20 and 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money. She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\n", "text": "The answer is $15.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the problem. Let's denote the price of each skirt as \"x\". Since Emily bought 2 skirts, the total cost of the skirts is 2x. Additionally, she spent $20 on art supplies. So, the total cost of everything she bought is 2x + $20.\n\nAccording to the problem, Emily spent a total of $50. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n2x + $20 = $50.\n\nTo isolate the variable, we subtract $20 from both sides of the equation:\n2x = $50 - $20,\n2x = $30.\n\nFinally, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:\nx = $30 / 2,\nx = $15.\n\nTherefore, Emily paid $15 for each of the skirts.
