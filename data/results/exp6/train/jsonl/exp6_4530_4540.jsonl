He also has a sheep ranch with 10 times the number of cows, with each sheep drinking 1/4 times as much water as a cow does. How many liters of water does Mr. Reyansh use to water all of his animals in a week?\n\nThe cows on Mr. Reyansh's dairy farm drink a total of 40 cows * 80 liters/cow/day = <<40*80=3200>>3200 liters of water a day.\nIn a week, the cows drink 3200 liters/cow/day * 7 days/week = <<3200*7=22400>>22400 liters of water in total.\nMr. Reyansh has 10 times as many sheep as cows, so there are 10 sheep/cow * 40 cows = <<10*40=400>>400 sheep on the sheep ranch.\nEach sheep drinks 1/4 times as much water as a cow, so each sheep drinks 80 liters/cow * 1/4 = <<80*1/4=20>>20 liters/day.\nIn a week, the sheep drink 20 liters/sheep/day * 7 days/week = <<20*7=140>>140 liters each in total.\nIn total, the sheep drink 140 liters/sheep * 400 sheep = <<140*400=56000>>56000 liters of water in a week.\nSo, in total, Mr. Reyansh uses 56000 liters for his sheep + 22400 liters for his cows = <<56000+22400=78400>>78400 liters of water in a week.

How many liters of water does Mr. Reyansh use to water all of his animals in a week?\n\nThe total water consumption for the cows in one day is 80 liters/cow/day * 40 cows = <<80*40=3200>>3200 liters/day\nThe total number of sheep on the ranch is 10 cows * 40 cows = <<10*40=400>>400 sheep.\nIf each cow drinks 80 liters/day, each sheep will drink 1/4 * 80 liters/day = <<80*1/4=20>>20 liters/day\nIn one day, the total amount of water that the sheep consume is 400 sheep * 20 liters/sheep/day = <<400*20=8000>>8000 liters/day\nIn one week, the cows will have consumed 3200 liters/day * 7 days/week = <<3200*7=22400>>22400 liters of water in a week.\nIn one week, the sheep will have consumed 8000 liters/day * 7 days/week = <<8000*7=56000>>56000 liters of water in a week.\nTherefore, Mr. Reyansh's animals will have consumed a total of 22400 liters/week + 56000 liters/week = <<22400+56000=78400>>78400 liters/week.

If there are 24 legs/paws in the pool, how many dogs do Daisy and Rose have?\n\nLet's assume Daisy and Rose each have x dogs.\nSince each dog has 4 legs, the number of dog legs in the pool is 4x.\nThe number of human legs in the pool is 2 (Daisy) + 2 (Rose) = 4\nThe total number of legs in the pool is 4x + 4 = 24.\nSubtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get: 4x = 20.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get: x = 5.\nTherefore, Daisy and Rose have 5 dogs each.
