If the book's price is decreased by 15% and then increased by 40%, what is the final price of the book?\n\nThe price of the book decreased by 15/100*400 = $<<15/100*400=60>>60\nThe price the book became after it decreased by 15% is 400-60 = $<<400-60=340>>340\nThe price of the book increased by 40/100*340 = $<<40/100*340=136>>136\nThe price of the book after increasing by 40% is 136+340 = $<<136+340=476>>476. Answer: \\boxed{476}.\n\n\nQuestion: The price of a book was $400. If the book's price is decreased by 15% and then increased by 40%, what is the final price of the book?\n\nWhen the price of the book is reduced by 15%, the price is calculated as 15/100*$400=$<<15/100*400=60>>60\nThe new price of the book is $400-$60=$<<400-60=340>>340.\nWhen the price is increased by 40%, the price is 40/100*$340=$<<40/100*340=136>>136 added to the previous price.\nThus, the new price of the book becomes $340+$136=$<<340+136=476>>476.

If the book's price is decreased by 15% and then increased by 40%, what is the final price of the book?\n\nIf the price of the book is decreased by 15%, the new price is 85/100*$400 = <<85/100*400=340>>340\nIf the price of the book is increased by 40%, the price increases by 40/100*$340 = $<<40/100*340=136>>136\nThe final price of the book is $340+$136 = $<<340+136=476>>476.

If the book's price is decreased by 15% and then increased by 40%, what is the final price of the book?\n\nIf the book's price is decreased by 15%, the new price becomes 100% - 15% = 85% of the original price.\nThat is 85/100*$400 = $<<85/100*400=340>>340\nWhen the price is increased by 40%, the new price becomes $340+$340*(40/100) = $<<340+340*(40/100)=476>>476. Answer: \\boxed{476}.\n\n\nQuestion: The price of a book was $400. If the book's price is decreased by 15% and then increased by 40%, what is the final price of the book?\n", "text": "To find the final price of the book, we need to perform two operations - decrease the price by 15% and then increase the price by 40%. \n\nDecreasing the price by 15% means we need to find 85% of $400. To do this, we multiply $400 by 0.85: $400 * 0.85 = $340.\n\nNext, we need to increase the price by 40%. To do this, we find 40% of $340 and then add it to $340. To find 40% of $340, we multiply $340 by 0.40: $340 * 0.40 = $136. Adding this to $340, we get $340 + $136 = $476.\n\nTherefore, the final price of the book is $476. Answer: \\boxed{476}."}
