How many animals do they have on their farm?\n\nTwice as many cows as pigs are 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cows.\nOne cow is worth 3 pigs, so three fewer cows than twice as many cows as pigs are worth, are 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 / 3 = 20 cows.\nSo, the family has 20 cows - 3 cows = <<20-3=17>>17 cows.\nThere are six more goats than cows, so the family has 17 cows + 6 goats = <<17+6=23>>23 goats.\nTherefore, Hannah's family has a total of 10 pigs + 17 cows + 23 goats = <<10+17+23=50>>50 animals on their farm.

How many animals do they have on their farm?\n\nTwice as many cows as pigs is 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cows.\nHannah's family has three fewer than twice as many cows as pigs, or 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17 cows.\nHannah's family has six more goats than cows, or 17 + 6 = <<17+6=23>>23 goats.\nHannah's family therefore has a total of 10 pigs + 17 cows + 23 goats = <<10+17+23=50>>50 animals.

If the farmer has 56 animals total, how many goats does he have?\n", "text": "Let x represent the number of goats. \n\nThe number of cows is x + 4. \n\nThe number of pigs is twice the number of cows, so it is 2(x + 4) = 2x + 8. \n\nThe total number of animals is x + (x + 4) + (2x + 8) = 4x + 12. \n\nSince the total number of animals is 56, we have 4x + 12 = 56. \n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 4x = 44. \n\nDividing both sides by 4, we find x = 11. \n\nTherefore, the farmer has <<11=11>>11 goats.
