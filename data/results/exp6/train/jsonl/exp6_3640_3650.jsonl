If she starts work at 8 AM, how many pieces of laundry does she need to clean per hour?\n\nCarla has 4 hours to complete the laundry because 12 - 8 = <<12-8=4>>4\nCarla must clean 20 pieces of laundry per hour because 80 / 4 = <<80/4=20>>20. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Carla is dividing up chores for her two kids, Anna and Billy. She wants each of them to spend the same number of minutes working. Sweeping takes 3 minutes per room, washing the dishes takes 2 minutes per dish, and doing laundry takes 9 minutes per load. If Anna does the sweeping for 10 rooms and Billy does two loads of laundry, how many dishes should Billy wash so they spend the same amount of time doing chores?\n", "text": "First find how long Anna spends sweeping by multiplying the time per room by the number of rooms: 3 minutes/room * 10 rooms = 30 minutes\nThen find how long Billy spends doing laundry by multiplying the time per load by the number of loads: 9 minutes/load * 2 loads = 18 minutes\nThen subtract Billy and Anna's total chore time from each other to find the difference: 30 minutes - 18 minutes = 12 minutes\nThen divide the time difference by the time per dish to find the number of dishes Billy should wash: 12 minutes / 2 minutes/dish = 6 dishes. Answer: \\boxed{6}."}
