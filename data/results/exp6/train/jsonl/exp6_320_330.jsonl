If my total bill was $140, the sales tax in my city is 10%, I ordered a NY Striploin for $80, and I ordered a glass of wine for $10, how much did they charge me for gratuities?\n\nTo calculate the amount charged for gratuities, we first need to find the total amount before taxes by adding the cost of the NY Striploin and the glass of wine: $80 + $10 = $<<80+10=90>>90.\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of taxes by multiplying the total amount before taxes by the tax rate: $90 * 0.10 = $<<90*0.10=9>>9.\nFinally, we can calculate the total bill by adding the total amount before taxes and the amount of taxes: $90 + $9 = $<<90+9=99>>99.\nSince the total bill was $140, the amount charged for gratuities without the customer's awareness is $140 - $99 = $<<140-99=41>>41.

Silas said he would pay for half of the bill and the remaining friends could split the rest of the bill and leave a 10% tip for the whole meal.

How many motorcycles are at the parking lot?\n\nThe total number of wheels of the cars in the parking lot is 19 cars \u00d7 5 wheels = <<19*5=95>>95 wheels.\nThe number of motorcycle wheels is: 117 wheels - 95 wheels = <<117-95=22>>22 wheels.\nHence the number of motorcycles in the parking lot is 22 wheels \u00f7 2 wheels each motorcycle = <<22/2=11>>11 motorcycles.

There are 19 cars in the parking lot. Altogether all vehicles have 117 wheels. How many motorcycles are at the parking lot?\n\nThere are 19 cars in the parking lot, so the total number of car wheels is 19 x 5 = <<19*5=95>>95 wheels.\nIf we subtract the wheels from the motorcycles, we find there are 117 - 95 = <<117-95=22>>22 motorcycle wheels.\nThis means there are 22 / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 motorcycles at the parking lot. Answer: \\boxed{11}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 20 bicycles, 10 cars and 5 motorcycles in the garage at Connor's house. How many wheels are there in the garage?\n\nThe number of wheels on a bicycle is 2 wheels, so the total number of wheels from the bicycles is 20 bicycles * 2 wheels/bicycle = <<20*2=40>>40 wheels.\nThe number of wheels on a car is 4 wheels, so the total number of wheels from the cars is 10 cars * 4 wheels/car = <<10*4=40>>40 wheels.\nThe number of wheels on a motorcycle is 2 wheels, so the total number of wheels from the motorcycles is 5 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = <<5*2=10>>10 wheels.\nThe total number of wheels in the garage is 40 wheels + 40 wheels + 10 wheels = <<40+40+10=90>>90 wheels. Answer: \\boxed{90}.\n\n\nQuestion: A used car lot has 24 cars and motorcycles (in total) for sale. A third of the vehicles are motorcycles, and a quarter of the cars have a spare tire included. How many tires are on the used car lot\u2019s vehicles in all?\n", "text": "There are 24 vehicles in total, and a third of them are motorcycles, so there are (1/3)*24 = <<(1/3)*24=8>>8 motorcycles. \nTherefore, there are 24-8 = <<24-8=16>>16 cars.\nA quarter of the cars have a spare tire, which means (1/4)*16 = <<(1/4)*16=4>>4 cars have a spare tire.\nSo, there are 16-4 = <<16-4=12>>12 cars without a spare tire.\nEach car with a spare tire has 5 tires, so there are 4 cars * 5 tires/car = <<4*5=20>>20 tires in cars with spare tires.\nEach car without a spare tire has 4 tires, so there are 12 cars * 4 tires/car = <<12*4=48>>48 tires in cars without a spare.\nThe motorcycles have 8 bikes * 2 tires/bike = <<8*2=16>>16 tires.\nIn total, there are 20 tires in cars with spares + 48 tires in cars without spares + 16 tires on motorcycles = <<20+48+16=84>>84 tires on the used car lot's vehicles. \nAnswer: \\boxed{84}."}
