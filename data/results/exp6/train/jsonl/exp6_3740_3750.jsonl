If Lucy is working 24 hours this week, how many aquariums could she clean?\n\nLucy can clean 2 aquariums in 3 hours. This means she can clean 2/3 of an aquarium in 1 hour (2 aquariums / 3 hours = 2/3 aquariums per hour).\n\nIf Lucy is working 24 hours this week, she can clean 24 hours * 2/3 aquariums per hour = <<24*2/3=16>>16 aquariums. Answer: \\boxed{16}.\n\n\nQuestion: Ethyl bought Lucy two new dolls for her doll collection.  This increased the doll collection by 25%.  After the addition of the two new dolls, how many dolls are in Lucy's collection?\n\nLet D = number of dolls in Lucy's collection\nTwo added to Lucy's collection represents 25% of D, so 2 = 0.25D\nDividing both sides of the equation by .25 gives D = 2/.25 = <<8=8>>8.\nThus thanks to the addition of the two new dolls, Lucy now has 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 dolls in her collection.
