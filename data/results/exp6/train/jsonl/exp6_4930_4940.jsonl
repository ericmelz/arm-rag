She fills the 5-liter bucket and pours as much as she can into the 3-liter bucket. Then, she pours the remainder into the 6-liter bucket. How much more water, in liters, can she put into the 6-liter bucket, without overflowing?\n\nSince the 3-liter bucket is smaller than the 5-liter bucket, Hamza can fill the 3-liter bucket completely. Thus, she pours 3 liters of water into the 3-liter bucket, leaving 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 liters in the 5-liter bucket.\nShe then pours the remaining 2 liters into the 6-liter bucket, leaving 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4 liters empty space. Therefore, Hamza can put up to 4 liters more water into the 6-liter bucket without overflowing.

She fills the 5-liter bucket and pours as much as she can into the 3-liter bucket. Then, she pours the remainder into the 6-liter bucket. How much more water, in liters, can she put into the 6-liter bucket, without overflowing?\n\nFirst, calculate how much water is left in the 5-liter bucket after pouring as much as possible into the 3-liter bucket: 5 liters - 3 liters = <<5-3=2>>2 liters\nThen calculate how much space is left in the 6-liter bucket by subtracting the amount of water already in it from its total capacity: 6 liters - 2 liters = <<6-2=4>>4 liters.

In the first break of the match, the 11 players on the field each take two bottles of water from Samira's box, and at the end of the game, take one more bottle each. How many bottles of water are remaining in Samira's box?\n\nA dozen water bottles equals 12 bottles.\nTherefore, four dozen water bottles equal 12*4 = <<12*4=48>>48 bottles.\nAfter the first half, the number of bottles that the 11 players took is 11*2 = <<11*2=22>>22\nAfter the match, the number of bottles that the 11 players took is 11*1 = <<11*1=11>>11\nTherefore, the total number of bottles that the players took is 22+11 = <<22+11=33>>33\nThe number of bottles remaining in Samira's box is 48-33= 15. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Arabella is a dance student learning three new steps this session. Her instructor has her spend thirty minutes on learning the first step. The second step she masters in half the time. The third step is more complex, so it takes her as long as both the other steps to learn. How many minutes did she spend learning the three steps?\n\nArabella spent 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 minutes on the second step.\nIt takes her (30 + 15) = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes to learn the third step.\nSo, Arabella spent a total of 30 + 15 + 45 = <<30+15+45=90>>90 minutes learning the three steps.
