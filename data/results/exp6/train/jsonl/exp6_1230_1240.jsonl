Assuming Casey's nails will be done when all coats have been applied and dried,  how many minutes will it take her to finish decorating her fingernails and toenails?\n\nCasey wants to do a base coat, a coat of paint, and a coat of glitter on every nail, so that's 3 coats in total.\nIt takes 20 minutes to apply each coat, so it will take a total of 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 minutes to apply all the coats.\nIt also takes 20 minutes for each coat to dry, so it will take a total of 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 minutes for all coats to dry.\nTherefore, it will take Casey a total of 60 + 60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes to finish decorating her fingernails and toenails.

So how much change did she take?\n\nThe total cost of the pants is 2 * $54 = $<<2*54=108>>108.\nThe total cost of the shirts is 4 * $33 = $<<4*33=132>>132.\nThe total cost of all items is $108 + $132 = $<<108+132=240>>240.\nSo Laura received $250 - $240 = $<<250-240=10>>10 in change. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Laura is hosting a carwash. She will charge $5 for a car, $6 for a truck, and $7 for an SUV. They raised $100 in total. If they washed 5 SUVs and 5 trucks, how many cars did they wash?\n", "text": "The total amount raised from the trucks is $6 x 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30.\nThe total amount raised from the SUVs is $7 x 5 = $<<7*5=35>>35.\nSo the total amount raised from the trucks and SUVs is $30 + $35 = $<<30+35=65>>65.\nTherefore, the total amount raised from the cars is $100 - $65 = $<<100-65=35>>35.\nHence, they washed $35 / $5 = <<35/5=7>>7 cars. Answer: \\boxed{7}."}
