On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday. On Thursday and Friday, it is about 10 cars each day. On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day. How many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday?\n\nOn Monday, there are 20/100 * 25 = <<20/100*25=5>>5 cars less traffic than on Tuesday.\nSo on Monday, 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 cars pass Happy Street.\nOn Wednesday, there are 20 + 2 = <<20+2=22>>22 cars.\nSo from Monday to Wednesday, there are 25 + 20 + 22 = <<25+20+22=67>>67 cars passing Happy Street.\nOn Thursday and Friday, there are 10 + 10 = <<10+10=20>>20 cars.\nOn the weekend there are only 5 + 5 = <<5+5=10>>10 cars passing.\nSo in total there are 67 + 20 + 10 = <<67+20+10=97>>97 cars passing Happy Street from Monday through Sunday.

If the morning and evening traffic is similar and he drives at an average speed of 30mph in the morning, what is the average speed of his return journey?\n\nTo find the average speed of his return journey, we need to calculate the distance he travels in the evening first.\n\nIn the morning, he drives for 1 hour at an average speed of 30mph, so he covers a distance of 1 * 30 = <<1*30=30>>30 miles.\n\nIn the evening, he drives for 1.5 hours. Since the distance traveled in both morning and evening is the same, he covers a distance of 30 miles in 1.5 hours, giving an average speed of 30/1.5 = <<30/1.5=20>>20mph. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tony is driving his car between his town and a friend's down. The towns are 120 miles apart and he gets there in 3 hours. The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?\n\nTony drives 120 miles in 3 hours, so his speed is 120/3 = <<120/3=40>>40 miles per hour.\nSince his speed is 40 miles per hour, the drive to his second friend's house will take him 200/40 = <<200/40=5>>5 hours.

How many did Alyssa eat?\n\nLet's say Alyssa ate x chicken nuggets.\nKeely ate twice as many as Alyssa, so Keely ate 2x chicken nuggets.\nKendall also ate twice as many as Alyssa, so Kendall ate 2x chicken nuggets.\nThe total number of chicken nuggets that Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall ate is x + 2x + 2x = 5x.\nSince they ordered 100 chicken nuggets, this means that 5x = 100.\nTherefore, Alyssa ate x = 100/5 = <<100/5=20>>20 chicken nuggets.
