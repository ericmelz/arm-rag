Answer: \\boxed{150}.\n\n\nQuestion: Missy watches 5 28-minute reality shows and one 10-minute cartoon. How long does she spend watching TV?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total time for the reality shows. Since there are 5 reality shows and each show lasts 28 minutes, the total time for the reality shows is 5 * 28 = 140 minutes.\nThen, we add the time for the cartoon, which is 10 minutes.\nTherefore, Missy spends a total of 140 + 10 = <<140+10=150>>150 minutes watching TV.
