If the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, how tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?\n\nLet's assume the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is x inches.\nIf the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B, then they were 20/100*x inches taller than the sunflowers from Packet B.\nSince the height of the sunflowers from Packet A was 192 inches, then 20/100*x = 192 inches - x.\nIf we simplify the left side of the equation, we get 20/100*x = 0.2*x.\nSo, 0.2*x = 192 inches - x.\nIf we add x to both sides of the equation, we get 0.2*x + x = 192 inches.\nSo, 1.2*x = 192 inches.\nIf we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2, we get x = 192 inches / 1.2.\nSo, x = <<192/1.2=160>>160 inches.
