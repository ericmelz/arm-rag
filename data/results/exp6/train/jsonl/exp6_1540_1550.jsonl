If she drives herself, the trip will take her 3 hours and 15 minutes.  If she takes an airplane, she will first need to drive 10 minutes to the airport, and then wait 20 minutes to board the plane.  After that, she will be on the airplane for one-third of the time it would have taken her to drive herself before landing in the destination city. Finally, it will take her an additional 10 minutes to get off the airplane and arrive at her interview site after the plane lands.

Given this information, how many minutes faster is it for her to take the airplane?\n\nTo find out how many minutes faster it is for the woman to take the airplane, we first need to convert the 3 hours and 15 minutes she would spend driving to minutes. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.\nTherefore, the woman would spend a total of 180 + 15 = <<180+15=195>>195 minutes driving herself.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time it would take her if she took the airplane:\n\nDriving to the airport: 10 minutes\nWaiting to board: 20 minutes\nTime spent on the airplane: 1/3 * 195 minutes = 65 minutes\nGetting off the airplane and arriving at the interview site: 10 minutes\n\nAdding all these times together, the total time it would take her if she took the airplane is 10 + 20 + 65 + 10 = <<10+20+65+10=105>>105 minutes.\n\nTo find out how many minutes faster it is for her to take the airplane, we subtract the total time it would take her to drive from the total time it would take her to fly:\n\n195 - 105 = <<195-105=90>>90.\n\nTherefore, it is 90 minutes faster for the woman to take the airplane.

Finally, it will take her an additional 10 minutes to get off the airplane and arrive at her interview site after the plane lands.  Given this information, how many minutes faster is it for her to take the airplane?\n", "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it would take for the woman to take the airplane and the total time it would take for her to drive herself.\n\nThe trip will take her 3 hours and 15 minutes, or a total of 3 * 60 + 15 = 195 minutes.\n\nIf she takes the airplane, she will spend 10 minutes driving to the airport, 20 minutes waiting to board, and 10 minutes getting off the airplane and arriving at her interview site. This totals to 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 minutes.\n\nIn addition, she will be on the airplane for one-third of the driving time, which is 195 / 3 = 65 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total time for her to take the airplane is 40 + 65 = 105 minutes.\n\nTo find out how many minutes faster it is for her to take the airplane, we subtract the total time it would take her to drive from the total time it would take her to take the airplane:\n\n195 - 105 = 90 minutes.\n\nThus, it is 90 minutes faster for her to take the airplane. Answer: \\boxed{90}."}
