How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\n\nThe second dog carried off one less than the first dog, or 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 bones.\nThe third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog, or 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 bones.\nThe fourth dog carried off one bone.\nThe fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog, or 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 bones.\nIn all, the dogs carried off 3+2+4+1+2=<<3+2+4+1+2=12>>12 bones. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: A pack of dogs found a pile of bones in the dumpster behind the butcher shop.  One by one, the dogs crawled into the dumpster, grabbed a mouthful of bones, and ran off with their newfound treasure.  In all, there were 5 dogs.  The first dog carried off 3 bones.  The second dog carried off 1 less bone than the first dog.  The third dog carried off twice as many as the second dog.  The fourth dog carried off one bone, and the fifth dog carried off twice the number of bones as the fourth dog carried, leaving no remaining bones in the dumpster.  How many bones were in the original pile of bones?\n\nLet x be the number of bones initially in the pile.\nThe second dog carried off 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 bones.\nThe third dog carried off twice as many bones as the second dog, so it carried off 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 bones.\nThe fifth dog carried off twice as many bones as the fourth dog, so it carried off 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 bones.\nThere were no bones left in the dumpster, so the sum of the bones carried off by the dogs was 3+2+4+1+2=<<3+2+4+1+2=12>>12 bones.\nThus, the initial number of bones in the pile was x=12 bones.

Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons.  Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.  If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?\n\nThe graveyard has half of the skeletons, which is 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 skeletons\nSplit between the remaining skeletons equally are, so there are 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 adult men\nAnd there are 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 children\nThe woman has 20 bones, so all together they are 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 bones\nThe men have 5 more than the woman, so they each have 20+5=25 bones\nSo the men have 25*5=<<25*5=125>>125 bones\nThe children have half the bones of the woman, which is 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 bones\nSo the children have 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 bones\nAll together there are 200+125+50=<<200+125+50=375>>375 bones.

If the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime in his till, plus a bunch of nickels, how many nickels does Mark get in his change?\n\nFirst, we must determine how much money Mark spends in total. $4.20 + $2.05 = $<<4.20+2.05=6.25>>6.25.\nThen we must determine how much money Mark received in change. $7.00 - $6.25 = $<<7.00-6.25=0.75>>0.75.\nWe know from the problem that the cashier only has a quarter and a dime. $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35.\nWe must now determine how many nickels equal 0.75 - 0.35 = $0.40.\nWe then divide 0.40 by the value of a nickel, 0.05. 0.40 / 0.05 = <<0.4/0.05=8>>8.
