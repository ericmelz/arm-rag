If the sales from Wednesday were tripled on Thursday, how many books did Matias sell during these three days combined?\n\nMatias sold 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 books on Wednesday.\nSo in total for the first two days Matias sold 7 + 21 = <<7+21=28>>28 books.\nOn Thursday he sold on Wednesday - <<21=21>>21) * 3 = <<63=63>>63 books.\nSo in total for these 3 days combined Matias sold 28 + 63 = <<28+63=91>>91 books.

How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?\n\nIf the shadows stretch 5 feet every hour, and we want to find the length of the shadows 6 hours past noon, we need to find 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 feet.\nSince 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the length of the shadows 6 hours past noon is 30 * 12 = <<30*12=360>>360 inches. Answer: \\boxed{360}.\n\n\nQuestion: Andrew works in a company that provides a generous vacation allotment: for every 10 days worked, you get 1 vacation day. If last year Andrew worked 300 days and took 5 days off in March and twice as many in September, how many more vacation days can Andrew still take?\n\nAndrew worked 300 days last year, so he can have 300 / 10 = <<300/10=30>>30 vacation days.\nIn September he took off twice as many days as in March, which means 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 days off.\nSo in total, Andrew took 5 days off in March + 10 days off in September = <<5+10=15>>15 days off.\nTherefore, he still has 30 vacation days - 15 days off = <<30-15=15>>15 vacation days.
