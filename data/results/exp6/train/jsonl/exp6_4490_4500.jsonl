If she plays for 8 minutes how many mistakes will she make on average?\n\nFirst find how many notes Nadia plays in total: 8 minutes * 60 notes/minute = <<8*60=480>>480 notes\nThen multiply that number by the fraction of notes she messes up to find the number of mistakes: 480 notes * 3 errors / 40 notes = <<480*3/40=36>>36 errors.

If she plays for 8 minutes how many mistakes will she make on average?\n", "text": "Nadia makes 3 mistakes per 40 notes. We can represent this as a ratio: 3 mistakes / 40 notes. \nIf she plays for 8 minutes, she will play for a total of 60 notes/minute * 8 minutes = 480 notes. \nTo find the average number of mistakes she will make, we can use the ratio. \nMultiply the ratio by the number of times it repeats in the 480 notes: (3 mistakes / 40 notes) * (480 notes / 40 notes) = 36 mistakes. \nTherefore, Nadia will make an average of 36 mistakes when playing for 8 minutes.
