How many tiles will she need?\n\nFirst we need to determine the area of the mosaic by multiplying the height and length of the wall. The area is 10 ft * 15 ft = <<10*15=150>>150 square feet.\nSince each tile is 1 square inch, we need to convert the area to square inches by multiplying the area by 144 square inches per square foot. 150 ft^2 * 144 in^2/ft^2 = <<150*144=21600>>21,600 square inches.\nFinally, we divide the total square inches by the area of each tile: 21,600 in^2 / 1 in^2/tile = <<21600=21600>>21,600 tiles.

If Manny wants to buy one portable table and two chairs, how much will be left in his $100?\n\nSince five plastic chairs cost $55, one plastic chair costs $55/5 = $<<55/5=11>>11.\nTherefore, three plastic chairs amount to $11 x 3 = $<<11*3=33>>33.\nSo, the portable table costs $33.\nHence, a portable table and two chairs cost $33 + 2 x $11 = $<<33+2*11=55>>55.\nThus, Manny will have $100 - $55 = $<<100-55=45>>45 left in his $100. Answer: \\boxed{45}.\n\n\nQuestion: Three plastic chairs cost as much as a portable table. Five plastic chairs cost $55. If Manny wants to buy one portable table and two chairs, how much will be left in his $100?\n\nIf five plastic chairs cost $55, then one plastic chair cost $55/5 = $<<55/5=11>>11.\nThus, three plastic chairs cost 3 x $11 = $<<3*11=33>>33.\nSo, a portable table costs $33.\nTherefore, the cost of one portable table and two chairs amounts to $33 + (2 x $11) = $<<33+(2*11)=55>>55.\nTherefore, Manny will have $100 - $55 = $<<100-55=45>>45 left. Answer: \\boxed{45}.\n\n\nQuestion: Three plastic chairs cost as much as a portable table. Five plastic chairs cost $55. If Manny wants to buy one portable table and two chairs, how much will be left in his $100?\n", "text": "To find the cost of one plastic chair, we divide the cost of five chairs by 5, which is $55/5 = $11. Therefore, the cost of three plastic chairs is 3 x $11 = $33. Since three chairs cost the same as one portable table, the cost of the table is also $33.\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of two chairs. Since one chair costs $11, two chairs will cost 2 x $11 = $22.\nTo find the total cost of one table and two chairs, we add the cost of the table and the cost of the chairs, which is $33 + $22 = $55.\nFinally, to find out how much will be left in Manny's $100, we subtract the total cost from $100: $100 - $55 = $45. \nTherefore, Manny will have $45 left.

If Roger has twice the recommended number of apps, how many apps must he delete for his phone to function optimally again?\n\nThe recommended number of apps is 35 and Roger has twice the recommended number, so he has 2*35 = <<35*2=70>>70 apps.\nTo have his phone function optimally, Roger must delete 70-50 = <<70-50=20>>20 apps.
