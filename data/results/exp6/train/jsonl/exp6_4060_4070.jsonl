If Maryann needs to rescue three of her friends who have expensive handcuffs on their hands and cheap handcuffs on their ankles, how long will it take for her to free all of them?\n\nIf Maryann can pick the lock on a cheap pair of handcuffs in 6 minutes, she can free one friend in 6 minutes.\nSince she has to free three friends, it will take her 6 minutes x 3 friends = <<6*3=18>>18 minutes to free all her friends from the cheap handcuffs.\nIf she can pick the lock on an expensive pair of handcuffs in 8 minutes, she will free one friend in 8 minutes.\nSince she has to free three friends from expensive handcuffs, it will take her 8 minutes x 3 friends = <<8*3=24>>24 minutes to free all her friends from the expensive handcuffs.\nTherefore, it will take her a total of 18 minutes + 24 minutes = <<18+24=42>>42 minutes to free all her friends. Answer: \\boxed{42}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mary and Ann are going sledding. Mary slides down a hill that's 630 feet long at a speed of 90 feet/minute. Ann slides down a hill that's 800 feet long at a rate of 40 feet/minute. How much longer does Ann's trip take than Mary?\n\nMary's trip takes 630 / 90 = <<630/90=7>>7 minutes.\nAnn's trip takes 800 / 40 = <<800/40=20>>20 minutes.\nAnn's trip takes 20 - 7 = <<20-7=13>>13 minutes longer than Mary's.

Then, she hung up the string of sausage links in her cooler.  Later that evening, Brandy, Sam\u2019s Golden Retriever, broke into the cooler and ate 12 links of sausage.  After Brandy\u2019s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links?\n\nSam made a total of 40 sausage links, and Brandy ate 12 of them, so there were 40 links - 12 links = <<40-12=28>>28 links remaining.\nEach link was made from a 10-pound meat mix, so the remaining links utilize only 10 pounds/ 40 links = <<10/40=.25>>.25 pounds/link.\nBecause each pound contains 16 ounces, each remaining link now has .25 pounds/link * 16 ounces/pound = 4 ounces/link.\nWith 28 links remaining, the total quantity of remaining sausage meat weighs 4 ounces/link * 28 links = <<4*28=112>>112 ounces.

After Brandy\u2019s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links?\n\nIf Sam ground up 10 pounds of meat into sausage, then the links each account for 10/40=<<10/40=0.25>>0.25 pounds of meat.\nThus, each link contains 0.25*16=<<0.25*16=4>>4 ounces of meat.\nIf Brandy ate twelve of the sausage links, then she ate 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 ounces of sausage meat.\nThus, the remaining links contain 40-12=<<40-12=28>>28 sausage links.\nThus, the remaining sausage links contain 28*4=<<28*4=112>>112 ounces of sausage meat.

After Brandy\u2019s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links?\n\nEach link of sausage was 10 pounds / 40 links = <<10/40=0.25>>0.25 pounds of sausage.\nSince there are 16 ounces in every pound, each link of sausage contained 0.25 pounds / pound * 16 ounces / pound = <<0.25*16=4>>4 ounces of sausage.\nLeftover were 40 links - 12 links = <<40-12=28>>28 links of sausage.\nThus, the remaining links contained a total of 28 links * 4 ounces = <<28*4=112>>112 ounces of sausage.

She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?\n\nLet X be the number of packages delivered by the third butcher.\nThus, the total number of packages delivered by the first butcher is 10 - X.\nAnd the total number of packages delivered by the second butcher is 7.\nAll these packages weigh 4 * (10 - X) + 4 * 7 + 4X = 100 pounds.\nThus, 40 - 4X + 28 + 4X = 100 pounds.\nThus, 68 = 100 pounds.\nThus, the third butcher delivered 100 - 68 = <<100-68=32>>32 pounds.\nTherefore, the third butcher delivered 32 / 4 = <<32/4=8>>8 packages.
