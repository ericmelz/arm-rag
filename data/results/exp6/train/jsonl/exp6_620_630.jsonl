How many rabbits did Jasper see in the park today?\n\nIf seven more rabbits are added to the thirteen in the cage, the total number of rabbits will be 13+7 = <<13+7=20>>20 rabbits.\nIf seven more rabbits are added to the thirteen in the cage, the number of rabbits in the cage will be 1/3 the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today, meaning there were 3*20 = <<3*20=60>>60 rabbits in the park. Answer: \\boxed{60}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a James Bond movie party, each guest is either male (M) or female (F. 40% of the guests are women, 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears, and 60% of the males are wearing rabbit ears. If the total number of guests at the party is 200, given all this information, what is the total number of people wearing rabbit ears?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of women at the party. We know that 40% of the guests are women, so 40% of 200 is (40/100)*200 = <<40/100*200=80>>80.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of women wearing rabbit ears. We know that 80% of the women are wearing rabbit ears, so 80% of 80 is (80/100)*80 = <<80/100*80=64>>64.\nThen, we need to calculate the number of men at the party. We know that the total number of guests is 200, and 80 of them are women, so the number of men is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120.\nNext, we need to calculate the number of men wearing rabbit ears. We know that 60% of the men are wearing rabbit ears, so 60% of 120 is (60/100)*120 = <<60/100*120=72>>72.\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of people wearing rabbit ears by adding the number of women wearing rabbit ears (64) and the number of men wearing rabbit ears (72), which is 64 + 72 = <<64+72=136>>136. Answer: \\boxed{136}.\n\n\nQuestion: If seven more rabbits are added to the thirteen in the cage, the number of rabbits in the cage will be 1/3 the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today. How many rabbits did Jasper see in the park today?\n", "text": "Let R represent the number of rabbits Jasper saw in the park today. \n\nAccording to the problem, if seven more rabbits are added to the thirteen in the cage, the number of rabbits in the cage will be 1/3*R. \n\nTherefore, we can write the equation: 13 + 7 = 1/3 * R.\n\nSimplifying, we have 20 = 1/3 * R.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 gives us 3 * 20 = R.\n\nTherefore, R = 60.\n\nJasper saw 60 rabbits in the park today.
