How much money will he manage to save by buying these shoes and not spending the assumed maximum amount?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discount Marcus got for the shoes, which is 30/100 * 120 = $<<30/100*120=36>>36.\nThen we subtract the discount from the initial price to find the final price, which gives us 120 - 36 = $<<120-36=84>>84.\nIf Marcus decided not to buy the shoes, which price exceeded $130, he would have to spend 130 - 84 = $<<130-84=46>>46 more.\nSo in total Marcus managed to save 46 dollars, as he would have to pay 130 - 84 = $<<130-84=46>>46 more.

Answer: \\boxed{1040}.\n\n\nQuestion: Brittany, Alex, and Jamy all share 600 marbles divided between them in the ratio 3:5:7. If Brittany gives Alex half of her marbles, what's the total number of marbles that Alex has?\n", "text": "The total ratio representing the marbles is 3+5+7=<<3+5+7=15>>15.\nThe fraction representing the ratio for Brittany is 3/15, which means she has (3/15)*600=<<3/15*600=120>>120 marbles.\nAlex's ratio is 5/15, and since there are 600 marbles assigned to them as a group, he has (5/15)*600= <<5/15*600=200>>200 marbles.\nIf Brittany gives half of her marbles to Alex, he receives 1/2*120 = <<1/2*120=60>>60 marbles.\nThe total number of marbles that Alex has now is 60+200 = <<60+200=260>>260. Answer: \\boxed{260}."}

The website was offering free shipping over $50.00.  They also had a deal that when you buy 4 books; the first two were 25% off.  Book 1 cost 13.00 and Book 2 cost 15.00.  Book 3 & 4 were both $10.00 each.  How much more money did Connor need to spend to receive free shipping?\n\nThe first two books were 13 + 15 = $<<13+15=28.00>>28.00.\nConnor only had to pay $28.00 - 25% = $<<28-25*.01*28=21.00>>21.00 for the first two books.\nThe total was 21 + 10 + 10 = $<<21+10+10=41.00>>41.00.\nConnor needed to spend 50 - 41 = $<<50-41=9.00>>9.00 more to get free shipping.

How much more money did Connor need to spend to receive free shipping?\n", "text": "To calculate how much more money Connor needed to spend to receive free shipping, we need to find the total cost of the books he wanted to order and then subtract $50.00 from that amount.\n\nThe first two books cost $13.00 and $15.00, so the subtotal for those two books is $13.00 + $15.00 = $28.00.\n\nSince there is a 25% discount on the first two books, Connor only has to pay 100% - 25% = 75% of the subtotal.\nSo the cost of the first two books after the discount is 75% of $28.00, which is $28.00 * 0.75 = $21.00.\n\nThe cost of books 3 and 4 is $10.00 each, so the subtotal for those books is $10.00 + $10.00 = $20.00.\n\nTo find the total cost of the books, we add the subtotal for the first two books ($21.00) and the subtotal for books 3 and 4 ($20.00): $21.00 + $20.00 = $41.00.\n\nFinally, to find how much more money Connor needs to spend, we subtract $41.00 from $50.00: $50.00 - $41.00 = $9.00.\n\nTherefore, Connor needs to spend $9.00 more to receive free shipping. Answer: \\boxed{9}."}
