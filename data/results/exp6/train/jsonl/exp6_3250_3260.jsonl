Answer: \\boxed{11}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 50 passengers on a bus.  At the first stop, 16 more passengers get on the bus. On the other stops, 22 passengers get off the bus and 5 passengers more get on the bus. How many passengers are there on the bus in total at the last station?\n\nAt the first stop, the number of passengers increases by 16, so there are 50 + 16 = <<50+16=66>>66 passengers on the bus.\nOn the other stops, 22 passengers get off the bus, so only 66 - 22 = <<66-22=44>>44 passengers are left.\nAt the other stops, 5 more passengers get on the bus, so in total there are 44 + 5 = <<44+5=49>>49 passengers on the bus at the last stop. Answer: \\boxed{49}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 50 passengers on a bus.  At the first stop, 16 more passengers get on the bus.

He ate 2/5 of them on Monday, half of the remaining on Tuesday and saved the rest for Friday. If he ate 3/4 of the remaining boar sausages on Friday, how many sausages are left?\n\nMr Castiel ate 2/5 x 600 = <<2/5*600=240>>240 sausages on Monday.\nSo, he still has 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 sausages left on Tuesday.\nThen, he ate 360/2 = <<360/2=180>>180 sausages on Tuesday.\nThus, he saved 360 - 180 = <<360-180=180>>180 sausages for Friday.\nTherefore, he ate 3/4 x 180 = <<3/4*180=135>>135 sausages on Friday.\nTherefore, he has 180 - 135 = <<180-135=45>>45 sausages left.

Answer: \\boxed{45}.\n\n\nQuestion: Sam the butcher made sausage by grinding up 10 pounds of spicy meat mix, loading it into a tube casing, and creating a string of 40 sausage links. Then, she hung up the string of sausage links in her cooler.  Later that evening, Brandy, Sam\u2019s Golden Retriever, broke into the cooler and ate 12 links of sausage.  After Brandy\u2019s feast, how many ounces of sausage meat were contained in the remaining links?\n\nSam made a total of 40 sausage links, and Brandy ate 12 of them, so there were 40 links - 12 links = <<40-12=28>>28 links remaining.\nEach link was made from a 10-pound meat mix, so the remaining links utilize only 10 pounds/ 40 links = <<10/40=.25>>.25 pounds/link.\nBecause each pound contains 16 ounces, each remaining link now has .25 pounds/link * 16 ounces/pound = 4 ounces/link.\nWith 28 links remaining, the total quantity of remaining sausage meat weighs 4 ounces/link * 28 links = <<4*28=112>>112 ounces.
