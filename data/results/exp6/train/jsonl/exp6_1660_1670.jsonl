Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Police officer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours. His colleague, officer B, patrols 55 streets in 5 hours. How many streets will both officers patrol in one hour?\n\nOfficer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours, so he patrols 36/4 = <<36/4=9>>9 streets in one hour.\nOfficer B patrols 55 streets in 5 hours, so he patrols 55/5 = <<55/5=11>>11 streets in one hour.\nThus, both officers will patrol 9+11 = <<9+11=20>>20 streets in one hour. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Police officer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours. His colleague, officer B, patrols 55 streets in 5 hours. How many streets will both officers patrol in one hour?\n\nThe first officer patrols 36 streets / 4 hours = <<36/4=9>>9 streets/hour.\nThe second officer patrols 55 streets / 5 hours = <<55/5=11>>11 streets/hour.\nIn total both officers patrol 9 streets/hour + 11 streets/hour = <<9+11=20>>20 streets/hour. Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Police officer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours. His colleague, officer B, patrols 55 streets in 5 hours. How many streets will both officers patrol in one hour?\n\nTo find the number of streets both officers patrol in one hour, we divide the total number of streets each officer patrols by the number of hours they spend patrolling. \n\nOfficer A patrols 36 streets in 4 hours, so he patrols 36 streets / 4 hours = <<36/4=9>>9 streets in one hour. \n\nOfficer B patrols 55 streets in 5 hours, so he patrols 55 streets / 5 hours = <<55/5=11>>11 streets in one hour. \n\nTherefore, both officers patrol 9 streets + 11 streets = <<9+11=20>>20 streets in one hour.
