Finally, one of her friends gets a discounted ticket through her job for 60% of the normal price. How much do Jenna's friends pay for their tickets in total?\n\nFirst calculate the price of the scalped tickets: $50 * 2 = $<<50*2=100>>100\nThen multiply that figure by 240% to find the price the scalper offers: $100 * 2.4 = $<<100*2.4=240>>240\nThen subtract $10 to find the price after the discount: $240 - $10 = $<<240-10=230>>230\nThen multiply the normal ticket price by the discount percentage to find the discount amount: $50 * .6 = $<<50*.6=30>>30\nThen add up the prices of all the tickets to find the total: $50 + $50 + $230 + $30 = $<<50+50+230+30=360>>360.

Matt uses it for 5 minutes at the highest setting.  How many vibrations does he experience?\n\nAt the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster than the lowest setting, or 1600*.6= <<1600*.6=960>>960 more vibrations per second.\nSo at the highest setting, it vibrates at 1600+960=<<1600+960=2560>>2560 vibrations per second.\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, and he uses it for 5 minutes, then at the highest setting, he experiences 2560*60*5=<<2560*60*5=768000>>768,000 vibrations.
