He received the wages for his first job, then later received the wages from his second job where he works 12 hours a week. If his second job pays $9 per hour then how much money, in dollars, did Mike receive from his first job?\n\nMike earned $9/hour x 12 hours/week = $<<9*12=108>>108 each week from his second job.\nTherefore, Mike received $160 - $108 = $<<160-108=52>>52 from his first job.

He received the wages for his first job, then later received the wages from his second job where he works 12 hours a week. If his second job pays $9 per hour then how much money, in dollars, did Mike receive from his first job?\n\nLet f be the amount Mike received from his first job\nHis second job paid 9 * 12 = <<9*12=108>>108 dollars per week.\nSo in total, he made f + 108 = <<f+108=160>>160 dollars a week.\nThus, Mike made f = 160 - 108 = <<160-108=52>>52 dollars from his first job.

He received the wages for his first job, then later received the wages from his second job where he works 12 hours a week. If his second job pays $9 per hour then how much money, in dollars, did Mike receive from his first job?\n\nFirst find the total number of hours Mike works his second job each week: 12 hours/week * $9/hour = $<<12*9=108>>108/week\nThen subtract his second job earnings from his total earnings to find his first job earnings: $160 - $108 = $<<160-108=52>>52.

He received the wages for his first job, then later received the wages from his second job where he works 12 hours a week. If his second job pays $9 per hour then how much money, in dollars, did Mike receive from his first job?\n", "text": "Let's assume that Mike received $x from his first job.\nMike's second job pays him $9 per hour, and he works 12 hours per week. So he earned $9 * 12 = $<<9*12=108>>108 from his second job.\nSince his total earnings were $160, we can set up the equation x + 108 = 160.\nSolving for x, we get x = 160 - 108 = <<160-108=52>>52.\nTherefore, Mike received $52 from his first job.
