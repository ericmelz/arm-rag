If he is left with $405, how much were his earnings?\n\nLet's assume Kenneth's earnings were x dollars.\nHe spent 10% of his earnings, which is 10/100*x = x/10 dollars.\nAfter buying the joystick, he is left with x - x/10 = 9x/10 dollars.\nGiven that he is left with $405, we can equate this to 9x/10 dollars: 9x/10 = $405.\nMultiplying both sides by 10/9, we get x = $450.\nTherefore, Kenneth's earnings were $450.

If he is left with $405, how much were his earnings?\n\nLet X be Kenneth's earnings.\nHe spent X*10%=$X/10 on the joystick.\nSo he has X-$X/10=$405 left.\nThus, 9X/10=$405.\nThus, X=$<<450=450>>450.
