If they split into 3 equally sized playgroups, each group contains 25 people. How many parents were at the park?\n\nThere are a total of 14 girls + 11 boys = <<14+11=25>>25 children.\nThus, there were 3 playgroups x 25 people/playgroup = <<3*25=75>>75 people at the park.\nTherefore, there were 75 people - 25 children = <<75-25=50>>50 parents at the park.

If their bus has a driver and an assistant, and the total number of boys on the trip is 50, calculate the total number of people on the bus considering the teacher also drives together with the students on the bus.\n\nIf there are 50 boys on the trip, the number of girls taken more than boys is 2/5*50 = <<2/5*50=20>>20 girls.\nThe total number of girls for the trip is 50+20 = <<50+20=70>>70 girls.\nTogether, the total number of people on the trip to the local museum is 70 girls+50 boys+1 teacher+1 driver+1 assistant = <<70+50+1+1+1=123>>123 people. Answer: \\boxed{123}.\n\n\nQuestion: My mother celebrated her birthday with a total of 60 guests. Half of the guests are women, 15 are men, and the rest are children. In the middle of the celebration, 1/3 of the men and 5 children left. How many people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration?\n\nHalf of the guests are women, which means 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 guests are women.\nSo, a total of 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 are either women or men.\nThe rest of the guests are children, which means 60 - 45 = <<60-45=15>>15 are children.\nAmong the men, 15/3 = <<15/3=5>>5 men left.\nTherefore, 5 + 5 = <<5+5=10>>10 guests left and walked away from the celebration.\nThus, 60 - 10 = <<60-10=50>>50 people stayed and enjoyed the birthday celebration. Answer: \\boxed{50}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 48 passengers on the bus. Two-thirds of the passengers are women and the rest are men.  If one-eighth of the men are standing, how many men are seated?\n\nTwo-thirds of the passengers on the bus are women, which means (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 of the passengers are men.\nThis means there are (1/3) * 48 = <<1/3*48=16>>16 men on the bus.\nIf one-eighth of the men are standing, then there are (1/8) * 16 = <<1/8*16=2>>2 men standing.\nTherefore, there are 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 men seated.

How many girls are at this party?\n\nThere are 50 x 30/100 = <<50*30/100=15>>15 boys.\nSo, 50 - 15 = <<50-15=35>>35 are girls.

The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?\n\nTo find out how long the drive will take, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n\nWe know that Tony drove 120 miles in 3 hours, so his speed was 120 miles / 3 hours = <<120/3=40>>40 miles/hour.\n\nNow, we can use this information to find out how long it will take for Tony to drive 200 miles: time = 200 miles / 40 miles/hour = <<200/40=5>>5 hours.\n\nSo the drive will take 5 hours.

What was the original price of the car?\n\nLet's say the original price of the car is \"x\".\n\nIf Venny spent $15000 on a used car which cost 40% of the original price, then the price of the used car is 40/100 * x = 0.40x\n\nBut we know that Venny spent $15000 on the used car.\n\nSo, 0.40x = $15000\nDividing both sides of the equation by 0.40, we get:\nx = $15000 / 0.40\nx = $37500\n\nTherefore, the original price of the car was $37500.
