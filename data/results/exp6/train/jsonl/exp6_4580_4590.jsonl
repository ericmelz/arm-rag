This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?\n\nMrs. Lim got a total of 68 + 82 = <<68+82=150>>150 gallons of milk yesterday.\nShe got 68 - 18 = <<68-18=50>>50 gallons of milk this morning.\nSo, she got a total of 150 + 50 = <<150+50=200>>200 gallons of milk.\nShe sold 200 - 24 = <<200-24=176>>176 gallons of milk.\nTherefore, her revenue for the milk is $3.50 x 176 = $<<3.5*176=616>>616.

If the owner spends 15 seconds cleaning up each egg and 30 minutes cleaning up each roll of toilet paper, how long (in minutes) will they have to spend cleaning up 60 eggs and 7 rolls of toilet paper?\n\nTo clean up 60 eggs, which take 15 seconds each to clean, the owner will spend 60 eggs * 15 seconds/egg = <<60*15=900>>900 seconds.\n900 seconds is 900 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = <<900/60=15>>15 minutes.\nTo clean up 7 rolls of toilet paper, which take 30 minutes each to clean, the owner will spend 7 rolls * 30 minutes/roll = <<7*30=210>>210 minutes.\nThe total time it takes to clean up both is 210 minutes + 15 minutes = <<210+15=225>>225 minutes.

If the owner spends 15 seconds cleaning up each egg and 30 minutes cleaning up each roll of toilet paper, how long (in minutes) will they have to spend cleaning up 60 eggs and 7 rolls of toilet paper?\n\nFirst find the total time spent cleaning up eggs: 15 seconds/egg * 60 eggs = 900 seconds\nThen find the total time spent cleaning up toilet paper: 30 minutes/roll * 7 rolls * 60 seconds/minute = 12600 seconds\nThen add the time spent on each task to find the total time spent: 900 seconds + 12600 seconds = <<900+12600=13500>>13500 seconds\nThen divide the total time spent by the number of seconds per minute to find the total time spent in minutes: 13500 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = <<13500/60=225>>225 minutes.

If the owner spends 15 seconds cleaning up each egg and 30 minutes cleaning up each roll of toilet paper, how long (in minutes) will they have to spend cleaning up 60 eggs and 7 rolls of toilet paper?\n\nCleaning up 60 eggs would take 60 eggs x 15 seconds/egg = <<60*15=900>>900 seconds.\nCleaning up 7 rolls of toilet paper would take 7 rolls x 30 minutes/roll x 60 seconds/minute = <<7*30*60=12600>>12,600 seconds.\nTherefore, cleaning up a total of 60 eggs and 7 rolls of toilet paper would take 900 seconds + 12,600 seconds = <<900+12600=13500>>13,500 seconds.\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, the owner will have to spend 13,500 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = <<13500/60=225>>225 minutes cleaning up. Answer: \\boxed{225}.\n\n\nQuestion: The Rotary Club is holding its annual fundraising Omelet Breakfast, with tickets sold in advance. The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?\n\nThe small children will eat a half omelet each, meaning they will eat 53 / 2 = <<53/2=26.5>>26.5 omelets.\nThe older children eat a whole omelet each, so they will eat 35 omelets.\nThe adults each eat two omelets, so they will eat 75 * 2 = <<75*2=150>>150 omelets.\nThe seniors each eat 1.5 omelets, so they will eat 37 * 1.5 = <<37*1.5=55.5>>55.5 omelets.\nThe total number of omelets needed is 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = 292 omelets.\nThus, they will need 292 * 2 = <<292*2=584>>584 eggs.
