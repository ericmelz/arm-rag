One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees.  Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky.  If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?\n\nLet X be the number of geese in the first formation.\nThe number of geese that break off is X/2.\nThe number of geese that remain flying is X - X/2 = X/2.\nThe number of geese that join the formation later is 4.\nThe final number of geese in the formation is (X/2) + 4 = 12.\nThen (X/2) = 12 - 4 = 8\nThen X = 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

How many feet has it traveled down the sidewalk after 11 gusts of wind?\n\nFor every 5 feet forward, the leaf is blown back 2 feet, so after one gust of wind, the leaf has travelled 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 feet.\nAfter 11 gusts of wind, the leaf has travelled 11 * 3 = <<11*3=33>>33 feet.

Answer: \\boxed{56}.\n\n\nQuestion: Albert noticed a flock of geese flying together in a V formation in the sky overhead.

If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?\n\nLet g be the number of geese in the first formation Albert noticed.\nAfter the half broke off, there were g/2 flying in the original formation.\nAfter 4 more geese joined, there were g/2 + 4 in the new formation.\nThus, the total number of geese is g/2 + 4 = 12.\nThus, g/2 = 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8\nFinally, the original number of geese is g = 2 * 8 = <<8*2=16>>16.

But on the second day, it warmed up enough that half of the snowdrift melted.  The third day, it snowed again, adding another 6 inches of snow onto the snowdrift.  On the fourth day, another 18 inches of snow fell onto the snowdrift.  If the snowdrift was 34 inches deep at the end of the fourth day, how deep in inches was the drift at the end of the first day?\n", "text": "Let d be the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day.\nOn the second day, half of the snowdrift melted, leaving (1/2)d inches of snow.\nOn the third day, it snowed again, adding 6 inches, so there were (1/2)d + 6 inches.\nOn the fourth day, another 18 inches fell, so there were (1/2)d + 6 + 18 = (1/2)d + 24 inches.\nSince the final depth was 34 inches, we have (1/2)d + 24 = 34.\nSubtracting 24 from both sides, we get (1/2)d = 10.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get d = 20.\nTherefore, the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the first day was 20 inches.
