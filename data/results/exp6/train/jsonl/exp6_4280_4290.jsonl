The landlord said that she needed to be able to pay 2 months' rent in advance to rent the place and she would also need to put down a deposit of $500.  How much more money did Janet need in order to rent the apartment?\n\nTwo months' rent would be 2*$1,250=$<<2*1250=2500>>2500.\nSo, in addition to first month's rent, Janet would need to pay 2*$1,250=$<<2*1250=2500>>2500.\nThis means that in addition to the $500 deposit, she would need to pay a total of $2,500+$500=$<<2500+500=3000>>3,000.\nThus, Janet needed $3,000-$2,225=$<<3000-2225=775>>775 more.

If there were 30 blonde-haired girls in the choir initially, how many black-haired girls are present?\n\nIf there were 30 blonde-haired girls in the choir initially and the number of new girls added to the choir was 10, the total number of blonde-haired girls in the choir is now 30+10=<<30+10=40>>40 girls.\nThe total number of girls in the choir after adding ten more blonde-haired girls is 80+10=<<80+10=90>>90\nIf we assume the number of black-haired girls in the choir after adding ten more blonde-haired girls is x, the sum of blonde and black-haired girls in the choir is 90 = 40+x\nThe value of x will be 90-40=<<90-40=50>>50 black-haired girls.

If he has 33 friends who are boys, how many friends does he have who are girls?\n\nIf 55% of Toby's friends are boys, then the percentage of his friends who are girls is 100% - 55% = 45%.\nIf 33 friends are boys, then 33/0.55 = <<33/0.55=60>>60 friends represent 45% in total.\nHence, Toby has 60 - 33 = <<60-33=27>>27 friends who are girls. Answer: \\boxed{27}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lizzy's mother gave her 80 cents and her father gave her 40 cents for keeping to her promise. She went to her uncle's and spent 50 cents buying candy for her little cousin. Her uncle gave her another 70 cents. How many cents does she have now?\n\nLizzy's mother and father gave her a total of 80 + 40 = <<80+40=120>>120 cents.\nAfter buying candy, she has 120 - 50 = <<120-50=70>>70 cents.\nHer uncle gave her another 70 cents, so she now has 70 + 70 = <<70+70=140>>140 cents. Answer: \\boxed{140}.\n\n\nQuestion: 55% of Toby's friends are boys and the rest are girls. If he has 33 friends who are boys, how many friends does he have who are girls?\n\nIf 55% of Toby's friends are boys, then 100% - 55% = 45% of his friends are girls.\nSince 33 of Toby's friends are boys, then 33 is equal to 55/100 * x, where x is the total number of Toby's friends.\nLet's solve the equation to find x, the total number of Toby's friends.\n33 = (55/100) * x\n33 = 55x/100\n33 * 100 = 55x\n3300 = 55x\nx = 3300/55\nx = <<60=60>>60\nTherefore, Toby has 60 - 33 = <<60-33=27>>27 friends who are girls.
