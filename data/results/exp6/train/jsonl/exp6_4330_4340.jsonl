If there are 10 blue, spotted fish, how many fish are there in the tank?\n", "text": "Let's assume the total number of fish in the tank is x. \nOne third of them are blue, so there are (1/3)*x blue fish. \nHalf of the blue fish have spots, so there are (1/2)*(1/3)*x = (1/6)*x blue spotted fish. \nWe are given that there are 10 blue spotted fish, so (1/6)*x = 10. \nTo find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6: \nx = 10 * 6 = 60. \nTherefore, there are 60 fish in the tank.

Then she decided she wouldn't use it anyway and sold it for $255. What percentage of the initial cost did she lose?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of money she lost. We do this by subtracting the amount she sold it for from the amount that she bought it for: $300 - $255 = $<<300-255=45>>45.\nNext, we need to determine what percentage of $300 is $45. We do this by dividing the amount she lost by the initial cost and multiplying by 100: ($45 / $300) * 100% = 15%.
