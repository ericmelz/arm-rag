If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?\n\nLet's assume that there were \"x\" lions in Londolozi at first.\nAfter 1 year, the number of lion cubs born is 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60.\nThe number of lions that died in a year is 1 * 12 = <<1*12=12>>12.\nSo, the number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year becomes \"x + 60 - 12 = 148.\"\nx + 48 = 148 is the equation representing the fact that the number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year is 148.\nThus, the number of lions in Londolozi at first is x = 148 - 48 = <<148-48=100>>100.

The printer blurs every third page, so it blurs $42/3 = 14$ pages. However, every seventh page is both crumpled and blurred, so we must subtract these cases off to avoid double-counting.

If he prints 42 pages, how many are neither crumpled or blurred?\n\nThe printer crumples every seventh page, which means it crumples 42 / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages.\nThe printer blurs the ink on every third page, which means it blurs 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages.\nHowever, some pages are both crumpled and blurred, so we need to subtract these from the total. This is because the crumpled pages are a multiple of 7, and the blurred pages are a multiple of 3, thus the multiples of the lowest common multiple are the duplicates. The printer crumples and blurs on every 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pages.\nThus, we must subtract the pages that are both crumpled and blurred, which is 42 / 21 = <<42/21=2>>2 pages.\nSo in total, he has 42 - 6 - 14 + 2 = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages that are neither crumpled nor blurred.

There are 365 days in a year, so 365 * 4 = <<365*4=1460>>1460 days in 4 years.\nSince James writes a comic every other day, we need to divide the total number of days by 2 to find the number of comics he has written: 1460 / 2 = <<1460/2=730>>730 comics.
