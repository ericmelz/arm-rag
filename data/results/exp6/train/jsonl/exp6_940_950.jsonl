How many days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently?\n", "text": "If Johnny had half as much practice as he currently has, that means he has been playing for 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 days.\nTo have 3 times the amount of practice he currently has, Johnny will need to practice for 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 days.\nSince he has already practiced for 40 days, he will need to practice for an additional 120 - 40 = <<120-40=80>>80 days to reach his goal.\nTherefore, it will take Johnny 80 more days of practice to have 3 times as much practice as he currently does. Answer: \\boxed{80}."}

Wanda also weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago. How much did Yola weigh 2 years ago if she currently weighs 220 pounds?\n\nLet's assume that Yola weighed x pounds 2 years ago.\nAccording to the problem, Wanda weighed 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago, which means Wanda weighed x + 80 pounds at that time.\nCurrently, Wanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola, so if Yola weighs 220 pounds now, Wanda weighs 220 + 30 = 250 pounds.\nSince Wanda weighed x + 80 pounds 2 years ago, we can write the equation x + 80 = 250.\nSubtracting 80 from both sides, we get x = 250 - 80 = 170 pounds.\nTherefore, Yola weighed 170 pounds 2 years ago.
