However, the number of cases increased by four times more per day as a new coronavirus variant started infecting people in a second wave. What was the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks?\n\nDuring the second wave, the number of infections increased by four times more per day, which means there were 4 * 300 = <<4*300=1200>>1200 more infections per day.\nSo, the total number of infections per day during the second wave was 300 infections/day + 1200 infections/day = <<300+1200=1500>>1500 infections/day.\nIn two weeks, there are 2 weeks * 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14 days.\nTherefore, the total number of infections during the second wave in 2 weeks is 1500 infections/day * 14 days = <<1500*14=21000>>21000 infections.
