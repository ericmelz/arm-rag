How many total cartons of milk are consumed by the students in the lunchroom?\n\nThere are 60% boys in the lunchroom because 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60\nThere are 600 students because 8 x 15 = <<8*15=120>>120\nThere are 240 girls because 120 x .4 = <<120*.4=48>>48\nThere are 72 boys because 120 - 48 = <<120-48=72>>72\nThe boys drink an average of 72 cartons of milk because 72 x 1 = <<72*1=72>>72\nThe girls drink an average of 96 cartons because 48 x 2 = <<48*2=96>>96\nThe students drink 168 cartons because 72 + 96 = <<72+96=168>>168.

How many total cartons of milk are consumed by the students in the lunchroom?\n\nThe number of students in the lunchroom is 8*15=<<8*15=120>>120 students\n40% of these students are girls, so there are 40/100*120=<<40/100*120=48>>48 girls\nThis means there are 120-48=<<120-48=72>>72 boys\nThe boys drink a total of 1*72=<<1*72=72>>72 cartons of milk\nThe girls drink a total of 2*48=<<2*48=96>>96 cartons of milk\nTogether, the students drink a total of 96+72=<<96+72=168>>168 cartons of milk.

There are 10 boys in the class and each boy today brought 5 cups for science activity class as Ms. Leech had instructed. If the total number of cups brought by the students in the class is 90, how many cups did each girl bring?\n\nTwice the number of boys in the class is 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20\nThe number of boys and girls in the class is 20+10 = <<20+10=30>>30\nThe girls in the class are 30 boys and girls - 10 boys = <<30-10=20>>20 girls.\nThe total number of cups brought by the boys in the class is 10 boys * 5 cups = <<10*5=50>>50 cups.\nThe population of the cups is 90 cups\nIf the total number of cups brought by all students in the class is 90 cups, then the total number of cups brought by the girls is 90 cups-50 cups = <<90-50=40>>40 cups.\nSince the number of girls in the class is 20, the number of cups each girl brought is 40 cups/20 girls = <<40/20=2>>2 cups.

There are 10 boys in the class and each boy today brought 5 cups for science activity class as Ms. Leech had instructed. If the total number of cups brought by the students in the class is 90, how many cups did each girl bring?\n\nTwice the number of boys in the class is the number of girls, so there are 2*10 boys = <<2*10=20>>20 girls in the class.\nThere are therefore 20+10= <<20+10=30>>30 students in the class, which is the total number of students Ms. Leech is teaching.\nDuring the science activity class period, the students brought to the class in total 5 cups/boy * 10 boys = <<5*10=50>>50 cups.\nThe girls brought in total 90 cups - 50 cups = <<90-50=40>>40 cups.\nIn total in the class there are 20 girls * x cups/girl = <<20*x=40>>40 cups.\nThis shows that each girl brought to the class 40 cups / 20 girls = <<40/20=2>>2 cups/girl.
