If the temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M., what was the temperature at 11 A.M.?\n\nFrom 3 A.M. to 11 A.M., there are 8 hours (11 A.M. - 3 A.M. = 8 hours).\nThe number of temperature increments in 8 hours is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\nHence, the temperature increased 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 degrees.\nThus, the temperature at 11 A.M. was 50 + 6 = <<50+6=56>>56 degrees.

If the temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M., what was the temperature at 11 A.M.?\n\nFrom 3 A.M. to 11 A.M., there are 8 hours: 11 - 3 = 8.\nIn 8 hours, the temperature rises by 1.5 degrees every 2 hours, which means it increases by 1.5 * 4 = <<1.5*4=6>>6 degrees.\nHence, the temperature at 11 A.M. was 50 + 6 = <<50+6=56>>56 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{56}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two days ago, the temperature in the morning went up 1.5 degrees every 2 hours. If the temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M., what was the temperature at 11 A.M.?\n\nFrom 3 AM to 11 AM, 8 hours have passed which is equivalent to 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 sets of 2 hours.\nHence, the temperature increase in 4 sets of 2 hours is 4 x 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 degrees.\nTherefore, the temperature at 11 AM is 50 + 6 = <<50+6=56>>56 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{56}.\n\n\nQuestion: September's temperature fluctuated severely in 1 week.  They started off with 40 degrees on Sunday then hit 50 on Monday, 65 on Tuesday, 36 on Wednesday, 82 on Thursday, 72 on Friday and ended the week at 26 on Saturday.  What was the average temperature for that week?\n\nTo find the average temperature for the week, we need to add up all the temperatures and divide by the number of days in the week.\n\nThe total sum of the temperatures is 40 + 50 + 65 + 36 + 82 + 72 + 26 = <<40+50+65+36+82+72+26=371>>371.\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so to get the average temperature we divide the total sum of temperatures by 7: 371 / 7 = <<371/7=53>>53.\n\nTherefore, the average temperature for the week is 53 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{53}.\n\n\nQuestion: The average temperature in Orlando in a particular week was 60 degrees. If the temperature on each of the first 3 days in that week was 40, and the temperature for Thursday and Friday was 80 degrees each, calculate the total temperature of the remaining days of that week.\n\nThe temperature for the first three days in that week was 40 degrees per day, a total of 3*40 = <<40*3=120>>120 degrees.\nThe temperature for Thursday and Friday which was 80 degrees for each day was 80*2 = <<80*2=160>>160 degrees\nThe total temperature for the first five days of that week is 160+120 = <<160+120=280>>280 degrees.\nThe average temperature for the whole week was 60 degrees, meaning the total temperature for the whole week was 7*60 = <<7*60=420>>420 degrees.\nThe total temperature for the remaining days of the week, which are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 420-280 = <<420-280=140>>140.

What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years?\n", "text": "To find the average temperature for July 4th over the past 5 years, we need to add up all the temperatures and divide by the number of years.\n\nThe total sum of temperatures is 90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = <<90+90+90+79+71=420>>420.\n\nSince we have data for 5 years, we divide the total sum of temperatures by 5: 420 / 5 = <<420/5=84>>84.\n\nTherefore, the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years is 84 degrees.
