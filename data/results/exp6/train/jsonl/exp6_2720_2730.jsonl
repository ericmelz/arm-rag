If his three-letter word became worth thirty points after being tripled, then before it was tripled, it was worth 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\nWe know that the first and third letters were each valued at one point, so that means the middle letter must have been worth 10-1-1=<<10-1-1=8>>8 points. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Jeremy loves to play Scrabble.  He once played a three-letter word on a triple word score to earn thirty points.  If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?\n\nWithout the triple word score bonus, the word was worth 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\nSince before the triple word score the first and third letters were worth one point apiece, they each account for a total of 1+1=<<1+1=2>>2 points.\nThus, the middle letter was valued at 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 points.

In August, the amount of work increased, and the company hired 200 more people. How much money does the company pay in total per month after the new hires?\n\nIn a day, each employee gets 10 * 12 = $<<10*12=120>>120.\nThis means that every week, each employee gets 120 * 5 = $<<120*5=600>>600.\nSo every month, each employee earns 600 * 4 = $<<600*4=2400>>2400.\nIf the company hires 200 more people, it hires a total of 500 + 200 = <<500+200=700>>700 people.\nThis means that before hiring the new people, the company paid 500 * 2400 = $<<500*2400=1200000>>1200000.\nSo when the company hired new people, it started paying 700 * 2400 = $<<700*2400=1680000>>1680000.
