Answer: \\boxed{27}.\n\n\nQuestion: On her birthday, Avianna bought red candles and blue candles in the ratio of 5:3. If Avianna had 45 red candles on her birthday, how many blue candles did she have?\n\nThe ratio of red candles to blue candles that Avianna bought is 5:3.\nSo for every 5 red candles, Avianna bought 3 blue candles.\nAnd if we represent the number of blue candles with 'x', then the number of red candles is 5x which is equal to 45.\nThus, 5x = 45\nTherefore, the value of x is 45/5 = <<45/5=9>>9\nTherefore, Avianna bought a total of 3*(9) = <<3*9=27>>27 blue candles. Answer: \\boxed{27}.\n\n\nQuestion: On her birthday, Avianna bought red candles and blue candles in the ratio of 5:3. If Avianna had 45 red candles on her birthday, how many blue candles did she have?\n\nIf the ratio of red candles to blue candles that Avianna bought on her birthday is 5:3, then the proportion representing the ratio of blue to red candles is 3/5.\nSince we're using the variables B and R to represent the number of blue and red candles respectively, and we know that there were 45 red candles, then 3/5 = B/45.\nUsing algebra, we can cross-multiply this proportion to get 5*B = 3*45.\nThis simplifies to 5B = 135.\nFinally, we divide both sides of the equation by 5 to find that B = <<27=27>>27 blue candles.

If Avianna had 45 red candles on her birthday, how many blue candles did she have?\n", "text": "The ratio of red candles to blue candles that Avianna bought is 5:3. This means that for every 5 red candles, there are 3 blue candles. We can set up a proportion to find the number of blue candles Avianna had. Let x represent the number of blue candles. Then the proportion is 5/3 = 45/x. To solve for x, we can cross multiply: 5x = 3 * 45. Simplifying, we have 5x = 135. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 27. Therefore, Avianna had 27 blue candles. Answer: \\boxed{27}."}

How many minutes total will it take for Tina to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment?\n\nIt will take Tina 14 keys x 3 minutes per key = <<14*3=42>>42 minutes to clean all the remaining keys.\nIt will take Tina 10 minutes to finish her assignment.\nIn total, it will take Tina 42 minutes cleaning the remaining keys + 10 minutes to finish her assignment = <<42+10=52>>52 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{52}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tina is working on her homework when she realizes she's having a hard time typing out her answers on her laptop because a lot of the keys are sticky. She is trying to get her homework done before dinner, though, so she needs to decide if she has time to clean her keyboard first. Tina knows her assignment will only take 10 minutes to complete.

How many citizens are in the town?\n\nLet's assume the total number of citizens in the town is x.\nGiven that 60% of citizens own a pet, which means 0.6x citizens own a pet.\nHalf of these pet owners own a dog, so 0.5 * 0.6x = 0.3x citizens own a dog.\nWe are told that 30 citizens own a cat.\nTherefore, we can conclude that 0.3x = 30.\nSimplifying, we find x = 30 / 0.3 = 100.\nThere are 100 citizens in the town.
