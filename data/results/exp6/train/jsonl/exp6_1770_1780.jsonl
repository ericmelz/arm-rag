The introduction will be 450 words, the conclusion will be triple the length of the introduction, and each of the four body sections will be the same length. If her essay has to be 5000 words total, how long is each section?\n\nLet x be the length of each body section.\nLet y be the length of the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is three times the length of the introduction, so y = 3(450) = 1350.\nThe total length of the body sections is 4x.\nThe total length of the introduction, body sections, and conclusion is 450 + 4x + 1350 = 5000.\nCombining like terms, we get 4x + 1800 = 5000\nSubtracting 1800 from both sides, we get 4x = 3200\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = 800\nSo each section is 800 words.

If Tod constantly drives 25 miles an hour the entire trip how many hours did Tod drive?\n\nTo find the total time it took Tod to drive, we need to find the total distance he traveled and divide it by his constant speed.\n\nFirst, we add the north and west distances together to find the total distance traveled: 55 miles + 95 miles = <<55+95=150>>150 miles\n\nThen, we divide the total distance by Tod's constant speed: 150 miles / 25 miles/hour = <<150/25=6>>6 hours.\n\nTherefore, Tod drove for 6 hours. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tod drives his family car 55 miles to the north and 95 miles to the west. If Tod constantly drives 25 miles an hour the entire trip how many hours did Tod drive?\n\nTo find the total time it takes Tod to drive, we need to find the time it takes him to drive 55 miles north and 95 miles west separately. \n\nTo find the time it takes Tod to drive 55 miles north, we divide the distance by the speed: 55 miles / 25 miles/hour = <<55/25=2.2>>2.2 hours. \n\nSimilarly, to find the time it takes Tod to drive 95 miles west, we divide the distance by the speed: 95 miles / 25 miles/hour = <<95/25=3.8>>3.8 hours. \n\nTherefore, the total time it takes Tod to drive 55 miles north and 95 miles west is 2.2 hours + 3.8 hours = <<2.2+3.8=6>>6 hours.

If each third of his trip takes 15 minutes, what is the distance Stephen rides his bicycle to church, in miles?\n\nTraveling at 16 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 16/60*15=<<16/60*15=4>>4 miles.\nTraveling at 12 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 12/60*15=<<12/60*15=3>>3 miles.\nTraveling at 20 miles per hour for 15 minutes is 20/60*15=<<20/60*15=5>>5 miles.\nThus, Stephen rides his church, in mile, a total of 4+3+5=<<4+3+5=12>>12 miles.
