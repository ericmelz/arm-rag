How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\n\nIf the tank is 1/3 full, and 16 gallons of water are added to fill it, then 16 gallons is 2/3 of the tank's capacity because 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\nThe tank holds 24 gallons because 16 / (2/3) = <<16/(2/3)=24>>24.

How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\n\nIf the gauge shows the tank is 1/3 full, then 16 gallons represents 1 - 1/3 = 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the tank's capacity.\nSince 2/3 of the tank's capacity is equal to 16 gallons, then 1/3 of the tank's capacity is equal to 16 gallons / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 gallons.\nTherefore, the tank is full when it is holding 8 gallons x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 gallons of water. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?\n\nIf the tank is 1/3 full of water, then the remaining capacity of the tank is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\nIf the tank requires 16 gallons of water to fill, then the capacity of the tank is 16 / (2/3) = <<16/(2/3)=24>>24. Answer: \\boxed{24}.\n\n\nQuestion: A company has a tank that is already filled at a maximum capacity of 350,000 gallons of water. One day the tank starts losing 32,000 gallons/hour for 5 hours, after that time the company repaired the tank but it wasn't enough because the tank was still losing 10,000 gallons/hour. It stayed like that for 10 hours. In the second attempt, they managed to repair the tank and started filling it with 40,000 gallons/hour. After 3 hours, how many gallons are missing for the tank to be at maximum capacity again?\n\nFor the first 5 hours, the tank lost 32,000 gallons/hour * 5 hours = <<32000*5=160000>>160,000 gallons.\nFor the next 10 hours, the tank lost 10,000 gallons/hour * 10 hours = <<10000*10=100000>>100,000 gallons.\nSo in total, the tank lost 160,000 gallons + 100,000 gallons = <<160000+100000=260000>>260,000 gallons.\nSo before the repair, the tank was left with 350,000 gallons - 260,000 gallons = <<350000-260000=90000>>90,000 gallons.\nAfter the repair, the tank has an additional 40,000 gallons/hour * 3 hours = <<40000*3=120000>>120,000 gallons.\nSo the final capacity of the tank is 90,000 gallons + 120,000 gallons = <<90000+120000=210000>>210,000 gallons.\nTherefore, the tank is missing 350,000 gallons - 210,000 gallons = <<350000-210000=140000>>140,000 gallons to be at maximum capacity again.

If the employees are paid $20 per hour, how much money does their boss spend paying all of them every month?\n\nIn a week Fiona works 40 hours, so in total, in a month Fiona works 4 weeks * 40 hours/week = <<4*40=160>>160 hours.\nJohn works 30 hours a week, so in a month, he works 4 weeks * 30 hours/week = <<4*30=120>>120 hours.\nJeremy works 4 weeks * 25 hours/week = <<4*25=100>>100 hours in a month.\nSo the total number of worked hours by all three of them is 160 + 120 + 100 = <<160+120+100=380>>380 hours.\nThis means that the total cost of their work in one month is 380 hours * $20/hour = $<<380*20=7600>>7600.

He allocated 20% of his total earnings to savings and the rest of the money to his monthly expenses. How much were his monthly expenses last month?\n\nRobert's commission for the month is $23600 x 10/100 = $<<23600*10/100=2360>>2360.\nSo, his total monthly earnings is $1250 + $2360 = $<<1250+2360=3610>>3610.\nThe amount he allocated for savings is $3610 x 20/100 = $<<3610*20/100=722>>722.\nTherefore, his monthly expenses is $3610 - $722 = $<<3610-722=2888>>2888.

When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n\nFirst find how much money one machine held: 80 quarters * $0.25/quarter + 100 dimes * $0.10/dime = $<<80*0.25+100*0.1=25+10=35>>35\nThen divide Erin's total earnings by the amount each machine held to find the number of machines: $90 / $35/machine = <<90/35=2.5714285714285716>>2.5714285714285716 machines\nSince Erin can't have part of a machine, round up to the next whole number: 2.5714285714285716 machines -> 3 machines.

Answer: \\boxed{40}.\n\n\nQuestion: Erin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines. There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?\n", "text": "Let's assume there are x machines in the launderette.\nEach machine has 80 quarters, which is 80 * $0.25 = $20 in quarters.\nEach machine has 100 dimes, which is 100 * $0.10 = $10 in dimes.\nSo, each machine holds a total of $20 + $10 = $30.\nSince Erin cashed in a total of $90, the number of machines in the launderette can be found by dividing $90 by $30/machine:\nx = $90 / $30 = 3.\nTherefore, there are 3 machines in the launderette. Answer: \\boxed{3}."}
