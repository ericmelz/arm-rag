How many hours does Steve spend with his family in a day?\n\nThe fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12).\n\nTo simplify the last fraction, we need to find the least common multiple of 3, 6, and 12.\n\n3 = 3 \u00d7 1,\n6 = 3 \u00d7 2,\n12 = 3 \u00d7 4.\n\nThe least common multiple is 3 \u00d7 4 = <<3*4=12>>12.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the day that Steve spends with his family is (1 - 1/3 - 1/6 - 1/12) = (12/12 - 4/12 - 2/12 - 1/12) = 5/12.\n\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, Steve spends (5/12) \u00d7 24 = <<(5/12)*24=10>>10 hours with his family. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks. Joey spent half as much this time (that Ethan spent learning the tricks) learning to swim. If Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation, how many days did it take Joey to learn swimming?\n\nIf a week has 7 days and Alexa spent a week and 2 days on vacation, she was on vacation for 7+2=<<7+2=9>>9 days.\nFOr 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn 12 fencing tricks, Alexa was on vacation for 9/x=3/4, where x is the number of days that Ethan took to learn the tricks.\nThe time it took Ethan to learn the 12 fencing tricks is x= 9*4/3 = 12 days.\nJoey spent half as much time this time (that Ethan spent learning the tricks) learning to swim, meaning he took 1/2*12 = <<1/2*12=6>>6 days to learn swimming. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Cathy and Chris got summer jobs at the cake shop and were supposed to work 20 hours per week each for 2 months.

Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar.  But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back.  His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies.  So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later.  The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.  How many cookies remained in the jar?\n\nLou Senior initially took 3 cookies out of the jar. After eating one and putting the other two back, he took a total of 4 cookies out of the jar. Louie Junior then took 7 cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom. \nTherefore, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar is 4 + 7 = 11.\nIf Debra accused Lou Senior of eating half of the cookies, it means that there were originally 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 cookies in the jar. \nSince 11 cookies were taken out, there were 22 - 11 = <<22-11=11>>11 cookies remaining in the jar.

When his coworker goes into anaphylactic shock and is taken to the hospital, Gerald is arrested. The judge sentences Gerald to 3 months for assault and 2 years for poisoning, then extends his sentence by 1/3 since this is Gerald's third offense. How many months does Gerald spend in jail?\n\nGerald's initial sentence is 3 months for assault and 2 years (24 months) for poisoning. \n\nThe total sentence before the extension is 3 + 24 = <<3+24=27>>27 months.\n\nSince this is Gerald's third offense, his sentence is extended by 1/3, which is (1/3) * 27 = <<(1/3)*27=9>>9 months.\n\nTherefore, Gerald spends a total of 27 + 9 = <<27+9=36>>36 months in jail.
