One day the tank starts losing 32,000 gallons/hour for 5 hours, after that time the company repaired the tank but it wasn't enough because the tank was still losing 10,000 gallons/hour. It stayed like that for 10 hours. In the second attempt, they managed to repair the tank and started filling it with 40,000 gallons/hour. After 3 hours, how many gallons are missing for the tank to be at maximum capacity again?\n\nFor the first 5 hours, the tank lost 32,000 gallons/hour * 5 hours = <<32000*5=160000>>160,000 gallons.\nFor the next 10 hours, the tank lost 10,000 gallons/hour * 10 hours = <<10000*10=100000>>100,000 gallons.\nSo in total, the tank lost 160,000 gallons + 100,000 gallons = <<160000+100000=260000>>260,000 gallons.\nSo before the repair, the tank was left with 350,000 gallons - 260,000 gallons = <<350000-260000=90000>>90,000 gallons.\nAfter the repair, the tank has an additional 40,000 gallons/hour * 3 hours = <<40000*3=120000>>120,000 gallons.\nSo the final capacity of the tank is 90,000 gallons + 120,000 gallons = <<90000+120000=210000>>210,000 gallons.\nTherefore, the tank is missing 350,000 gallons - 210,000 gallons = <<350000-210000=140000>>140,000 gallons to be at maximum capacity again.

Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feed weekly?\n\nThe squirrel eats a half cup of birdseed every week, so Ivan refills the feeder with 2 \u2013 .5 = <<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 cups of birdseed every week.\nIf each cup feeds 14 birds, then 1.5 cups of birdseed, enough to feed 14 * 1.5 = <<14*1.5=21>>21 birds every week.

Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feed weekly?\n\nEvery week Ivan loses 1/2 cup of birdseed to the squirrel. Once a week Ivan refills the 2 cup bird feeder, so he loses 1/2 * 2 = <<1/2*2=1>>1 cup of birdseed to the squirrel.\nIvan puts in 2 cups of birdseed but loses a half so the net contribution is 2 - 1/2 = <<2-1/2=1 1/2>>1.5 cups of birdseed\nTwo cups of bird seed can feed 14 birds so 1.5 cups can feed 14*1.5 = <<14*1.5=21>>21 birds.
