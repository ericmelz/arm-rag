Jenny can carry a total of 100 ounces. She collects 20 cans and as many bottles as she can carry. If she gets paid 10 cents per bottle and 3 cents per can, how much money does she make (in cents)?\n\nTo determine how many bottles she can carry, subtract the weight of the cans from the total weight Jenny can carry: 100 ounces - 20 cans * 2 ounces/can = <<100-20*2=60>>60 ounces\nThen divide the weight Jenny can carry by the weight per bottle to find how many bottles she can carry: 60 ounces / 6 ounces/bottle = <<60/6=10>>10 bottles\nThen multiply the number of bottles by the price per bottle to find Jenny's total earnings from the bottles: 10 bottles * 10 cents/bottle = <<10*10=100>>100 cents\nThen multiply the number of cans by the price per can to find Jenny's total earnings from the cans: 20 cans * 3 cents/can = <<20*3=60>>60 cents\nFinally, add Jenny's earnings from the cans and bottles to find her total earnings: 100 cents + 60 cents = <<100+60=160>>160 cents.

Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?\n\nThe cost of the tickets for the group is 6 * $50 = $<<6*50=300>>300.\nThe cost of the dinner for the group is 6 * $10 = $<<6*10=60>>60.\nHalf of the group buys the drink tickets, so 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 people.\nThe cost of the drink tickets for those three people is 3 * $30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.\nThe total cost for the group is $300 + $60 + $90 = $<<300+60+90=450>>450.\nThe group gets a 90% refund, so they lose 100% - 90% = 10% of the money.\nThe group lost 10% * $450 = $<<10*.01*450=45>>45.

One day as she was walking home from school, she dropped 1 kernel of popcorn per 25 feet she walked.  Later that evening, a squirrel came and ate one-quarter of the popcorn Jenny had dropped on her way home.  If Jenny walks to school the following morning and counts the popcorn on the ground, what is the total number of popcorn kernels she will find remaining on the ground?\n\nSince Jenny walked 5000 feet and dropped 1 kernel per 25 feet walked, she dropped 5000/25=<<5000/25=200>>200 popcorn kernels on the ground on her way home.\nA squirrel ate 1/4 of the popcorn that was dropped, or 200/4=<<1/4*200=50>>50 kernels.\nThus, the following morning, Jenny would find 200-50=<<200-50=150>>150 popcorn kernels on the ground.

If each butterfly spends 3 times as much time as a larva as in a cocoon, how long does each butterfly spend in a cocoon?\n\nLet \"x\" be the amount of time the butterfly spends in a cocoon.\nThe larva spends 3*x = 3x time inside the cocoon.\nThe total time from a larva to a butterfly is 3x + x = 4x.\nSince it takes 120 days for a butterfly to grow, then 4x = 120 days.\nThus, the butterfly spends x = 120/4 = <<120/4=30>>30 days inside the cocoon. Answer: \\boxed{30}.\n\n\nQuestion: It takes a butterfly egg 120 days to become a butterfly. If each butterfly spends 3 times as much time as a larva as in a cocoon, how long does each butterfly spend in a cocoon?\n\nLet's call the time spent as a larva \"L\" and the time spent in a cocoon \"C\".\nSince the butterfly spends three times as much time as a larva as in a cocoon, we can write the equation: L = 3C.\nWe also know that the total amount of time it takes for a butterfly to become a butterfly is 120 days, so: L + C = 120.\nSubstituting the value of L from the first equation into the second equation, we get: 3C + C = 120.\nCombining like terms, we have 4C = 120.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get C = 30.\nTherefore, each butterfly spends 30 days in a cocoon.
