Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Maddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?\n\nMaddie uses 2 cups of coffee * 1.5 ounces of coffee beans = <<2*1.5=3>>3 ounces of coffee beans per day.\nThis means she uses 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 ounces of coffee beans per week.\nSo she needs to buy 21 / 10.5 = <<21/10.5=2>>2 bags of coffee.\nThis will cost her 2 bags * $8/bag = $<<2*8=16>>16.\nShe also uses 1/2 gallon * 128 ounces/gallon = <<1/2*128=64>>64 ounces of milk per week.\nThis will cost her 64 / 128 * $4 = $<<64/128*4=2>>2.\nSo in total she spends $16 + $2 = $<<16+2=18>>18 on coffee each week.

How much does she spend on her coffee per week?\n\nMaddie uses 2 cups of coffee per day * 1.5 ounces of beans = <<2*1.5=3>>3 ounces of beans per day.\nShe uses 3 ounces of coffee beans per day * 7 days = <<3*7=21>>21 ounces per week.\nShe needs to buy 21 ounces of beans / 10.5 ounces per bag = <<21/10.5=2>>2 bags of coffee per week.\nSo she spends 2 bags * $8 per bag = $<<2*8=16>>16 per week on coffee beans.\nShe uses 1/2 gallon of milk * $4 per gallon = $<<1/2*4=2>>2 per week on milk.\nTherefore, she spends $16 + $2 = $<<16+2=18>>18 on coffee and milk per week. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Claire won a $100 gift card to her favorite coffee shop. She wants to treat herself to a latte that cost $3.75 and a croissant for $3.50 every morning for a week.  She also plans to buy 5 cookies that cost $1.25 each. How much money will be left on her card after a week of coffee and pastry?\n\nThe total cost of the latte and croissant is 3.75 + 3.50 = $<<3.75+3.5=7.25>>7.25 per day.\nFor a week of coffee and pastries, she will spend 7.25 * 7 = $<<7.25*7=50.75>>50.75.\nThe total cost of the cookies is 5 * 1.25 = $<<5*1.25=6.25>>6.25.\nThe total amount spent in a week is 50.75 + 6.25 = $<<50.75+6.25=57>>57.\nThe amount that will be left after a week is 100 - 57 = $<<100-57=43>>43.
