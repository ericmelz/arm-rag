She earns $.1 per word. She earns $60 per article. She has to finish three stories in the next 4 hours. She averages 10 words a minute. How much can she expect to earn per hour if she writes the entire time?\n\nThe reporter can write for a total of 4 hours x 60 minutes = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes.\nTherefore, she can write a total of 240 minutes x 10 words/minute = <<240*10=2400>>2400 words.\nShe will therefore earn a total of 2400 words x $.1/word = $<<2400*0.1=240>>240.\nAs she can earn $60 three times, she will therefore earn $60 x 3 = $<<60*3=180>>180 from her articles.\nThus, her total earnings will be $240 + $180 = $<<240+180=420>>420.\nTherefore, she can expect to earn $420 / 4 hours = $<<420/4=105>>105 per hour.

She sells 4 to her parents, 1 to her grandfather, 2 to the next-door neighbor and twice that amount to another neighbor.  How much money did Maggie earn?\n\nShe earns $5/sale and sells 4 subscriptions, so her parents cover 4*$5=$<<5*4=20.00>>20.00 in magazine subscriptions.\nShe earns $5/magazine sold and sells 1 magazine to her grandfather, so he covers 1*$5=$<<5*1=5.00>>5.00 in magazine subscriptions.\nShe earns $5/magazine sold and sells a total of 2 magazines to the next door neighbor, so this neighbor covers 2*$5=$<<5*2=10.00>>10.00 in magazine subscriptions.\nShe gets 2*$5=$<<2*5=10.00>>10.00/sale from one neighbor and sells twice that amount, so these 2 neighbors pay her additional 2*$10.00=$<<2*10=20.00>>20.00.\nIn total, she earns $20.00 from her parents, $5.00 from her grandfather, $10.00 from her next door neighbor, and $20.00 from her additional subscriptions making a grand total of $20+$5+$10+$20=$<<20+5+10+20=55.00>>55.00.

How much more would Janet make per month as a freelancer if there are four weeks in a month?\n\nJanet currently makes 40 hours/week * $30/hour = $<<40*30=1200>>1200 per week.\nThus, she currently makes $1200/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<1200*4=4800>>4800 per month.\nAs a freelancer, she would make 40 hours/week * $40/hour = $<<40*40=1600>>1600 per week.\nThus, she would make $1600/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<1600*4=6400>>6400 per month.\nJanet would pay an extra $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<25*4=100>>100 per month in FICA taxes.\nShe would also pay an extra $400/month in healthcare premiums.\nThus, she would make $6400 - $4800 - $100 - $400 = $<<6400-4800-100-400=1100>>1100 more per month as a freelancer.

Elle and Andrea will split the cost for buying 4 cans of soda which cost $1.50 each, and chicken wings for $10. Joe will buy a cake that costs $5. How much more will Mary spend than the rest of the firm put together?\n\nMary will spend a total of $20 + $2 = $<<20+2=22>>22.\nElle and Andrea will spend a total of $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6 for soda.\nThey will also spend a total of $6 + $10 = $<<6+10=16>>16 for soda and chicken wings.\nJoe will spend a total of $5.\nThe total amount that Elle, Andrea, and Joe will spend is $16 + $5 = $<<16+5=21>>21.\nTherefore, Mary will spend $22 - $21 = $<<22-21=1>>1 more than the rest of the firm put together.
