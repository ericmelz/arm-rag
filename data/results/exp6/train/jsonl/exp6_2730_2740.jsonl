How much money did the zoo make in total for both days?\n", "text": "On Monday, the zoo made 7 children * $3 = $21 from child tickets.\nOn Monday, the zoo made 5 adults * $4 = $20 from adult tickets.\nThe total revenue on Monday was $21 + $20 = $41.\nOn Tuesday, the zoo made 4 children * $3 = $12 from child tickets.\nOn Tuesday, the zoo made 2 adults * $4 = $8 from adult tickets.\nThe total revenue on Tuesday was $12 + $8 = $20.\nTherefore, the zoo made a total of $41 + $20 = $61 over both days.
