How many customers bought two watermelons?\n\nLet X be the number of customers that bought 2 melons.\nThen 46 = 17 + 3 * 3 + 2 * X.\nThen 46 = 17 + 9 + 2X.\nThen 2X = 20.\nThen X = <<10=10>>10.

How many customers bought two watermelons?\n\nSo far, the customers have bought 17 melons + 3 melons * 3 = <<17+3*3=26>>26 melons.\nThere were 46 melons \u2013 26 melons = <<46-26=20>>20 melons left.\nThus, 20 melons \u00f7 2 melons = <<20/2=10>>10 customers bought two melons. Answer: \\boxed{10}.\n\n\nQuestion: A watermelon stand sold 46 watermelons. Seventeen customers bought one melon, three customers bought three melons, and the rest bought two melons. How many customers bought two watermelons?\n\nLet the number of customers who bought two watermelons be $x$. The total number of customers can be expressed as $x+3+17 = x+20$. Since the total number of watermelons sold is 46, we have $2x + 3(3) + 17(1) = 46$. Expanding the expression gives $2x + 9 + 17 = 46$, so $2x = 46 - 26$, which reduces to $2x = 20$. Finally, dividing by 2 gives $x = \\boxed{10}$, which is the number of customers who bought two watermelons.\n\n\nQuestion: A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?\n\nIf each watermelon weighs 23 pounds and he sells them for $2 a pound, then he would make 23*2 = <<23*2=46>>46 dollars for each watermelon.\nIf he sold 18 watermelons of the same weight, he would make 18*46= <<18*46=828>>828 dollars.

What is his new total?\n\nJohn lost 30% of his squat, which is 30/100 * 700 = <<30/100*700=210>>210 pounds.\nSo his new squat is 700 - 210 = <<700-210=490>>490 pounds.\nJohn lost 200 pounds on deadlift, so his new deadlift is 800 - 200 = <<800-200=600>>600 pounds.\nHis new total is 490 + 400 + 600 = <<490+400+600=1490>>1490 pounds. Answer: \\boxed{1490}.\n\n\nQuestion: John used to go to the gym multiple times a weak but because of lockdowns he hasn't been able to go.  He used to lift 700 for squat, 400 for bench, and 800 for deadlift.  For squat he lost 30% of his lift.  He didn't lose any weight on bench because he was able to train that at home and he lost 200 pounds on deadlift.  What is his new total?\n\nFor the squat, he lost 30% of 700 pounds, which is 0.30*700 = <<30*.01*700=210>>210 pounds.\nSo his squat is now 700-210 = <<700-210=490>>490 pounds.\nFor deadlifts, he lost 200 pounds, so his new deadlift is 800-200 = <<800-200=600>>600 pounds.\nTherefore, his new total is 490+400+600 = <<490+400+600=1490>>1490 pounds. Answer: \\boxed{1490}.\n\n\nQuestion: John injures his shoulder while lifting weights.  After the injury, his bench press goes down 80%.  After a bit of training, he manages to triple the weight he can bench.  If he started with a 500-pound bench press, what is it now?\n\nHe lost 500*.8=<<500*.8=400>>400 pounds off his bench after the injury\nSo he could bench 500-400=<<500-400=100>>100 pounds\nHe increased this to a 100*3=<<100*3=300>>300-pound bench press. Answer: \\boxed{300}.\n\n\nQuestion: John injures his shoulder while lifting weights.  After the injury, his bench press goes down 80%.

She has 10 hens who lay eggs. She sells the eggs for $3 a dozen. In four weeks, she sold $120 worth of eggs. If she sold all the eggs her hens laid, how many eggs does each hen lay a week?\n\nIf she sells each egg for $0.25, Krista earned $120 in 4 weeks by selling 120/0.25=<<120/0.25=480>>480 eggs.\nKrista raised 10 hens, so each hen lays 480/10=<<480/10=48>>48 eggs in 4 weeks.\nSince there are 4 weeks in a month, each hen lays 48/4=<<48/4=12>>12 eggs a week.

How much money will she make in 2 weeks if she sells all her eggs?\n\nFirst find the total number of eggs each chicken lays each week: 10 chickens * 6 eggs/week/chicken = <<10*6=60>>60 eggs/week\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it from eggs to dozens: 60 eggs / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 dozen\nThen calculate how many dozen eggs she sells per week: 5 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $<<5*2=10>>10/week\nThen multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks per two weeks to find her total earnings: $10/week * 2 weeks = $<<10*2=20>>20.
