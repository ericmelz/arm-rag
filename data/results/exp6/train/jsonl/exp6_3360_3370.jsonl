If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?\n\nFor every 4 strawberries she picks, she eats 1 so in every group of 5 berries, she only adds 4 to the basket.\nIf her basket holds 60 strawberries, she will need to pick 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 handfuls of strawberries.\nSince each handful has 5 strawberries, Susan will need to pick 15 * 5 = <<15*5=75>>75 strawberries in total. Answer: \\boxed{75}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lilibeth and her friends go strawberry picking. Lilibeth fills 6 baskets where each basket holds 50 strawberries. If three of Lilibeth's friends pick the same amount as her, how many strawberries do Lilibeth and her friends pick in all?\n", "text": "Lilibeth picks a total of 6 baskets x 50 strawberries/basket = <<6*50=300>>300 strawberries.\nSince three of Lilibeth's friends also pick the same amount of strawberries, the total number of strawberries picked by Lilibeth and her friends is 300 strawberries + 300 strawberries x 3 friends = 300 strawberries + 900 strawberries = <<300+300*3=1200>>1200 strawberries.

Her brother and sister help her to pick up the berries and sell them to the market. Iris picked 30 blueberries, her sister picked 20 cranberries, and her brother was able to pick 10 raspberries. If 1/3 of the total berries they were able to pick are rotten and the remaining 1/2 of the fresh berries need to be kept, how many berries will they be able to sell?\n\nIris and her siblings were able to pick a total of 30 + 20 + 10 = <<30+20+10=60>>60 berries.\nBased on the given information, 60 x 1/3 = <<60*1/3=20>>20 berries are rotten.\nSo there are 60 - 20 = <<60-20=40>>40 fresh berries.\nTherefore, they will be able to sell 40 x 1/2 = <<40*1/2=20>>20 berries.
