Answer: \\boxed{110}.\n\n\nQuestion: At a party, there are 400 students, a combination of poets, singers and tree huggers. There are 50 more poets than treehuggers at the party. If the number of tree huggers is 120, how many singers are at the party?\n\nLet's assume the number of poets at the party is P.\nSince there are 50 more poets than tree huggers at the party, the total number of poets is P = 120 + 50 = <<120+50=170>>170.\nThe total number of students at the party is the sum of poets, tree huggers, and singers, so P + 120 + S = 400.\nSince the number of poets at the party is 170, this equation becomes 170 + 120 + S = 400.\nBy adding like terms, the equation becomes 290 + S = 400.\nSubtracting 290 from both sides, we get S = 400 - 290 = <<400-290=110>>110.
