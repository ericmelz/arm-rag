How much money does he profit?\n", "text": "He initially had 8 puppies and gave away half, so he had 8/2 = 4 puppies left.\nHe kept one of the remaining puppies, so he had 4 - 1 = 3 puppies left.\nHe sold each of these remaining puppies for $600, so his total earning from selling the puppies was 3 * $600 = $1800.\nHowever, he also had to pay the owner of the stud $300.\nTherefore, his total profit was $1800 - $300 = $1500. Answer: \\boxed{1500}."}
