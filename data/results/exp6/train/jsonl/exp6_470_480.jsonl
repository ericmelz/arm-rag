How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5?\n\nThere are 12 months in 1 year and 2 years have 12*2 = <<12*2=24>>24 months\nGary has to pay back $6,000 over 24 months so per month he must pay 6000/24 = $<<6000/24=250>>250\nIf Gary paid the loan back over 5 years, that\u2019s 5*12 = <<5*12=60>>60 months\nTo pay his dad back the full amount over 5 years Gary would have to pay his dad 6000/60 = $<<6000/60=100>>100 per month\nPaying his dad off in 2 years instead of 5 years costs Gary an extra 250-100 = $<<250-100=150>>150 per month.

Gary decided he would pay his dad back the full amount in 2 years.  How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5?\n\nTo pay off the car in 5 years Gary would need to pay his dad 6000/5 = $<<6000/5=1200>>1200 a year\nThat means that Gary would be paying his dad 1200/12 = $<<1200/12=100>>100 a month\nTo pay off the car in 2 years Gary would need to pay his dad 6000/2 = $<<6000/2=3000>>3000 a year\nThat means that Gary would be paying his dad 3000/12 = $<<3000/12=250>>250 a month\nSo Gary is spending 250-100 = $<<250-100=150>>150 more per month to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5.

If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?\n", "text": "Gary earns $12 per hour and earns 1.5 times his normal wage for each hour worked over 40. To find out how many hours Gary worked, we can subtract his regular earnings from his total paycheck. If we divide the overtime pay he received by his overtime wage, we can determine how many hours he worked in overtime. Adding the regular hours and overtime hours gives us the total hours Gary worked that week. \n\nSince Gary normally earns $12 per hour and worked overtime, his overtime wage is $12 * 1.5 = $18 per hour. \nFor the first 40 hours, Gary earned $40 * $12 = $480. \nThe overtime pay Gary received is $696 - $480 = $216. \nGary's overtime wages are therefore $216 / $18 = 12 hours worth of work. \nThus, Gary worked (40 + 12) = 52 hours that week.

If there are 1000 guests, how many more married people are there than children?\n\nIf 30% of the guests are married, then (30/100)*1000 = <<(30/100)*1000=300>>300 guests are married.\nIf 50% are single, then (50/100)*1000 = <<(50/100)*1000=500>>500 guests are single.\nThe total number of guests who are either married or single is 500+300 = <<500+300=800>>800 guests.\nThe number of children is 1000-800 = <<1000-800=200>>200.\nThe number of married people than children is 300-200 = <<300-200=100>>100.
