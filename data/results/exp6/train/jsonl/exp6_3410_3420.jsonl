If the chocolate bars each cost $2, how much did each bag of chips cost?\n\nThe chocolate bars cost Frank 5 * $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThe food items altogether cost Frank $10 + 2*x = $<<10+2*x=20>>20 - $4 = $16.\nThus, 2*x = $16 - $10 = $6.\nSo each bag of chips costs $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?\n\nWhen Thomas and his friends take 1/4 of the bars, they take 1/4*200 = 50 bars.\nWhen the friend returns some of the bars, the number of bars decreases to 200-50+5 = <<200-50+5=155>>155 bars.\nPiper takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends, a total of 50-5 = 45 bars.\nWhen Piper takes the bars, the number of bars remaining in the box reduces to 155-45 = <<155-45=110>>110.

If 8 kids and 10 adults swim in his swimming pool per day, how much money will he earn per week?\n\nThe daily earning from kids is $3 x 8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.\nThe amount earned from an adult is $3 x 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.\nSo the daily earning from adults is $6 x 10 = $<<6*10=60>>60.\nTherefore, the total daily earning from kids and adults is $24 + $60 = $<<24+60=84>>84.\nTherefore, the total weekly earning of Jose from his swimming pool is $84 x 7 = $<<84*7=588>>588.

If 8 kids and 10 adults swim in his swimming pool per day, how much money will he earn per week?\n\nIf each kid pays $3, then for the 8 kids, it will cost 8 * $3 = $<<8*3=24>>24 per day.\nThe cost for adults is twice the amount paid by kids, which means each adult pays $3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6\nFor 10 adults, they'll pay $6 * 10 = $<<6*10=60>>60 per day.\nThe total amount generated per day is $60 + $24 = $<<60+24=84>>84\nPer week, Jose will earn $84 * 7 days = $<<84*7=588>>588.

They started off with 40 degrees on Sunday then hit 50 on Monday, 65 on Tuesday, 36 on Wednesday, 82 on Thursday, 72 on Friday and ended the week at 26 on Saturday.  What was the average temperature for that week?\n\nTo find the average temperature for the week, we need to add up all the temperatures and divide by the number of days in the week.\n\nThe total sum of the temperatures is 40 + 50 + 65 + 36 + 82 + 72 + 26 = <<40+50+65+36+82+72+26=371>>371.\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so to get the average temperature we divide the total sum of temperatures by 7: 371 / 7 = <<371/7=53>>53.\n\nTherefore, the average temperature for the week is 53 degrees. Answer: \\boxed{53}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two days ago, the temperature in the morning went up 1.5 degrees every 2 hours. If the temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M., what was the temperature at 11 A.M.?\n\nFrom 3 A.M. to 11 A.M., there are 8 hours (11 A.M. - 3 A.M. = 8 hours).\nThe number of temperature increments in 8 hours is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\nHence, the temperature increased 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 degrees.\nThus, the temperature at 11 A.M. was 50 + 6 = <<50+6=56>>56 degrees.

If the temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M., what was the temperature at 11 A.M.?\n\nFrom 3 A.M. to 11 A.M., there are 8 hours: 11 - 3 = 8.\nIn 8 hours, the temperature rises by 1.5 degrees every 2 hours, which means it increases by 1.5 * 4 = <<1.5*4=6>>6 degrees.\nHence, the temperature at 11 A.M. was 50 + 6 = <<50+6=56>>56 degrees.

If the temperature was 50 degrees at 3 A.M., what was the temperature at 11 A.M.?\n\nFrom 3 AM to 11 AM, 8 hours have passed which is equivalent to 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 sets of 2 hours.\nHence, the temperature increase in 4 sets of 2 hours is 4 x 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 degrees.\nTherefore, the temperature at 11 AM is 50 + 6 = <<50+6=56>>56 degrees.

If the temperature on each of the first 3 days in that week was 40, and the temperature for Thursday and Friday was 80 degrees each, calculate the total temperature of the remaining days of that week.\n\nThe temperature for the first three days in that week was 40 degrees per day, a total of 3*40 = <<40*3=120>>120 degrees.\nThe temperature for Thursday and Friday which was 80 degrees for each day was 80*2 = <<80*2=160>>160 degrees\nThe total temperature for the first five days of that week is 160+120 = <<160+120=280>>280 degrees.\nThe average temperature for the whole week was 60 degrees, meaning the total temperature for the whole week was 7*60 = <<7*60=420>>420 degrees.\nThe total temperature for the remaining days of the week, which are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 420-280 = <<420-280=140>>140.
