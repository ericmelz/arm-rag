If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\n\nThere are 6 students with brown eyes and black hair, which is half the number of students with brown eyes, so there are 6*2= <<6*2=12>>12 students with brown eyes.\nAs two-thirds of the students have brown eyes, there are 12/(2/3)= 18 students in total. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair. If there are 6 students in the class with brown eyes and black hair, how many students are there in total?\n\nLet's say there are x students in total.\nIf two-thirds of the class have brown eyes, then 2/3*x=x*2/3 students have brown eyes.\nThis means there are (2/3)*x=2x/3 students with brown eyes.\nIf half the students with brown eyes have black hair, then (1/2)*(2x/3)=x/3 students have brown eyes and black hair.\nSince there are 6 students with brown eyes and black hair, we have x/3=6.\nThus, there are x=3*6=18 students in total. Answer: \\boxed{18}.\n\n\nQuestion: There are 100 people in a theater. If 19 of these people have blue eyes, half of them have brown eyes, a quarter have black eyes, and the rest have green eyes, how many of them have green eyes?\n\nIf 19 people have blue eyes, then the number of people with brown eyes is 100/2 = <<100/2=50>>50 people.\nSince a quarter have black eyes, then 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25 people have black eyes.\nThe total number of people with blue, brown, and black eyes is 19+50+25 = <<19+50+25=94>>94\nSince there are 100 people in the theater, the number of people with green eyes is 100-94 = <<100-94=6>>6 people. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Miss Molly surveyed her class of 30 students about their favorite color. Half of the class answered green, one-third of the girls answered pink, and the rest of the class answered yellow. If there are 18 girls in the class, how many students like yellow best?\n\nOut of the 30 students in the class, half prefer green, or 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 students.\nThe girls constitute 18 of the 30 students, therefore 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 students are boys.\nIf the girls are 18, then the boys must be 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 students.\n1/3 of the girls, or 1/3*18 = <<1/3*18=6>>6 girls, prefer the color pink.\nThe rest of the girls, or 18-6 = <<18-6=12>>12 girls, like yellow.\nSince 30-15-6 = <<30-15-6=9>>9 students did not answer either green or pink, then 9/12 = <<9/12=0.75>>0.75, or 75%, of the boys did not answer.\nSince there are 12 boys, then 75% of 12 = (0.75)*12 = <<(0.75)*12=9>>9 boys like yellow the best. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Two-thirds of the class have brown eyes. Half of the students with brown eyes have black hair.
