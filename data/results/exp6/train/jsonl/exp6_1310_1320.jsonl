What is the price of the television when calculating 15% of the value-added tax?\n\nTo calculate the value of the television including tax, you need to add the value-added tax (VAT) to the initial price.\n\nThe VAT is 15% of the initial price, which is 15/100 * $1700 = $<<15/100*1700=255>>255.\n\nSo, the price of the television including tax is $1700 + $255 = $<<1700+255=1955>>1955.

If the total sales price had a 25% discount, how much did Mrs. Taylor pay for the two televisions?\n\nEach television had a discount of 25/100 * $650 = $<<25/100*650=162.5>>162.5.\nSo each television cost $650 - $162.5 = $<<650-162.5=487.5>>487.5.\nThus, the total price of the two televisions was $487.5 x 2 = $<<487.5*2=975>>975. Answer: \\boxed{975}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mrs. Taylor bought two smart televisions that cost $650 each. If the total sales price had a 25% discount, how much did Mrs. Taylor pay for the two televisions?\n\nThe discount for each television is $650 x 25/100 = $<<650*25/100=162.5>>162.5.\nSo the cost of each television after the discount is $650 - $162.5= $<<650-162.5=487.5>>487.5.\nTherefore the total value of the televisions Mrs. Taylor bought is $487.5 x 2 = $<<487.5*2=975>>975.

If the price in 2001 was $1950, what was the price in 2009?\n\nSince the store decreases the price by $35 each year, the price decreased by $35 x (2009 - 2001) = $35 x 8 = $<<35*8=280>>280.\nTherefore, the price in 2009 was $1950 - $280 = $<<1950-280=1670>>1670. Answer: \\boxed{1670}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mrs. Taylor bought two smart televisions that cost $650 each.

Diego runs around half the block in 2.5 minutes and then is tripped by a dog and can't finish. Assuming he kept up the same speed the entire race, what would've been the average time in seconds for the racers?\n\nTo find the average time for the racers, we need to find the total time each runner ran and combine them, then divide by the number of racers.\n\nCarlos ran around the entire block in 3 minutes, which is 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 seconds.\n\nDiego ran half the block in 2.5 minutes, which is 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 seconds.\n\nIf Diego had completed the race, he would have taken 150 * 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 seconds to run the full block.\n\nThe total time for the raced combined is 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 seconds.\n\nSince there are 2 racers, the average time for the racers is 480 / 2 = <<480/2=240>>240 seconds. Answer: \\boxed{240}.\n\n\nQuestion: Peter and Andrew like to run in the morning.  Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew's 2 miles.  After 5 days, how many miles have they both run?\n\nAfter 5 days, Andrew has ran 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles.\nPeter has ran 5 * (2 + 3) = <<5*(2+3)=25>>25 miles.\nTogether, they have ran 10 + 25 = <<10+25=35>>35 miles. Answer: \\boxed{35}.\n\n\nQuestion: When Patrick, Manu, and Amy participate in a race they realize that Patrick finishes the race in 60 seconds. Manu took 12 more seconds to finish the race. If Amy is twice as fast as Manu, how long did it take her to finish the race?\n\nSince Manu took 12 seconds longer than Patrick to finish the race, he took 12+ 60 = <<12+60=72>>72 seconds to complete the race.\nSince Amy is twice as fast as Manu, it took her 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>36 seconds to complete the race.
