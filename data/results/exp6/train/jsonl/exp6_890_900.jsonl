How many cm is the height of the screen if the side of the square paper is 20 cm?\n\nThe perimeter of the square-shaped paper is 20 cm x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 cm.\nSo the height of the computer screen is 80 cm + 20 cm = <<80+20=100>>100 cm. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a square-shaped piece of paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of a computer screen. How many cm is the height of the screen if the side of the square paper is 20 cm?\n\nThe perimeter of the square is 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80\nLet x be the height of the computer screen.\nThe perimeter of the square is 20 cm shorter than the height of the screen, so 80 = x - 20\nAdding 20 to both sides, we get 80 + 20 = x\nCombining like terms, we get x = <<100=100>>100. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: The perimeter of a square-shaped piece of paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of a computer screen. How many cm is the height of the screen if the side of the square paper is 20 cm?\n", "text": "If the side length of the square paper is 20 cm, then the perimeter of the square is 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 cm. \nLet h be the height of the computer screen. \nAccording to the problem, the perimeter of the paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of the screen, so we can set up the equation h = 80 + 20. \nSimplifying the equation, we get h = <<80+20=100>>100 cm. \nTherefore, the height of the computer screen is 100 cm.
