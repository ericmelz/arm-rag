If Carson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but gets tired and skips 2 times, how far does he walk in one night?\n\nThe distance around the warehouse is given by the perimeter formula: 2(length + width)\nThe perimeter of the warehouse is 2(600 + 400) = 2(1000) = 2000 feet.\nCarson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but he skips 2 times, so he circles the warehouse 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 times.\nTherefore, Carson walks a total of 8 * 2000 = <<8*2000=16000>>16000 feet in one night.

If Carson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but gets tired and skips 2 times, how far does he walk in one night?\n\nTo find the distance Carson walks in one night, we first need to calculate the total distance he would walk if he completed all 10 circles around the warehouse.\n\nThe distance around the warehouse is equal to the perimeter of a rectangle. The formula to find the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get 2 * (600 + 400) = 2 * (1000) = 2000 feet.\n\nIf Carson were to complete 10 circles, he would walk a total distance of 2000 * 10 = <<2000*10=20000>>20000 feet.\n\nHowever, Carson skips 2 circles, so he walks a total distance of 20000 - (2 * 2000) = <<20000-(2*2000)=16000>>16000 feet.

Silas said he would pay for half of the bill and the remaining friends could split the rest of the bill and leave a 10% tip for the whole meal. How many dollars will one of the friends pay?\n", "text": "Silas paid for half of the bill, which is $150 * 0.5 = $<<150*0.5=75>>75.\nThe remaining bill is $150 - $75 = $<<150-75=75>>75.\nThe tip on the whole meal is $150 * 0.10 = $<<150*0.10=15>>15.\nThe total remaining bill and tip is $75 + $15 = $<<75+15=90>>90.\nSince there are 5 friends splitting the bill, each friend will pay $90 / 5 = $<<90/5=18>>18. Answer: \\boxed{18}."}
