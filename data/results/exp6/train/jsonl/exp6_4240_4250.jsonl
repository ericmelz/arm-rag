How on average, how many minutes does each player get?\n\nTo find the average amount of time each player gets, we need to add up the total amount of time and divide by the number of players. First add up all the time in seconds: 130 seconds + 145 seconds + 85 seconds + 60 seconds + 180 seconds = <<130+145+85+60+180=600>>600 seconds\nThen divide that amount by the number of players: 600 seconds / 5 players = <<600/5=120>>120 seconds\nThen divide that amount by the number of seconds per minute to express the answer in minutes instead of seconds: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = <<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

This means she will be donating 14 - 12 = <<14-12=2>>2 inches of her hair.\nSince she needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig, Patricia needs to grow her hair for an additional 23 - 2 = <<23-2=21>>21 inches. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: Patricia is growing her long very long to donate it to a charity that makes wigs for cancer survivors. Her hair is 14 inches long. She needs to donate 23 inches to make a wig. She wants her hair to be 12 inches long after the donation. How much longer does she have to grow her hair?\n\nTo have her hair be 12 inches long after the donation, she needs to donate 14 - 12 = <<14-12=2>>2 inches.\nThus, she has to grow her hair 23 - 2 = <<23-2=21>>21 inches. Answer: \\boxed{21}.\n\n\nQuestion: Patricia is making a highlight film about her basketball team. She recorded video of every player and plans to put it all together in a longer movie. She has 130 seconds of the point guard, 145 seconds of the shooting guard, 85 seconds of the small forward, 60 seconds of the power forward, and 180 seconds of the center. How on average, how many minutes does each player get?\n", "text": "To find the average length of each player's video, we need to calculate the total length of all the videos and then divide by the number of players. First, add up the lengths of each player's video: 130 seconds + 145 seconds + 85 seconds + 60 seconds + 180 seconds = <<130+145+85+60+180=600>>600 seconds. \nNext, we need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the total seconds by 60: 600 seconds / 60 = <<600/60=10>>10 minutes. \nFinally, to find the average length per player, we divide the total time by the number of players: 10 minutes / 5 players = <<10/5=2>>2 minutes per player. \nTherefore, each player on average gets 2 minutes of video footage. Answer: \\boxed{2}."}
