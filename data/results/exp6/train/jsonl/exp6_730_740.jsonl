If each bushel contains 48 apples, then how much profit, in dollars, does he make after selling 100 apples?\n\nHe buys apples for $12 per bushel, or $12/48 apples = $<<12/48=0.25>>0.25 per apple.\nHe buys 100 apples, so his costs are 100 apples * $0.25/apple = $<<100*0.25=25>>25.\nHe sells them for $0.40 per apple, so his total revenue is 100 apples * $0.40/apple = $<<100*0.40=40>>40.\nThus, his profit is $40 in revenue - $25 in costs = $<<40-25=15>>15.

How much are her total sales for the day?\n\nIn the morning, her total sales for apple is $1.50 x 40 = $<<1.5*40=60>>60.\nIn the morning, her total sales for orange is $1 x 30 = $<<1*30=30>>30.\nSo, her total sales in the morning is $60 + $30 = $<<60+30=90>>90.\nIn the afternoon, her total sales for apple is $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.\nIn the afternoon, her total sales for orange is $1 x 40 = $<<1*40=40>>40.\nSo, her total sales in the afternoon is $75 + $40 = $<<75+40=115>>115.\nTherefore, her total sales for the day is $90 + $115 = $<<90+115=205>>205.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 10 minutes is equal to 10/60 = 1/6 of an hour.\nTo find the required speed, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: 5 miles / (1/6 hour) = 5 * 6/1 = <<5*6=30>>30 miles per hour.\nTherefore, Marcos needs to go at a speed of 30 miles per hour to make it to work on time.

If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\n\nThere are 8 pints in a gallon, so the vampire needs to suck 7 x 8 = <<7*8=56>>56 pints of blood per week.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the vampire needs to suck 56 / 7 = <<56/7=8>>8 pints of blood per day.\nSince each person has 2 pints of blood, the vampire needs to suck 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 people each day to survive. Answer: \\boxed{4}.\n\n\nQuestion: A vampire needs to suck 7 gallons of blood per week to survive.  If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\n\nFirst, we need to convert 7 gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, 7 gallons is equal to 7 * 8 = <<7*8=56>>56 pints.\nNext, we need to determine how many pints the vampire needs to suck each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the vampire needs to suck 56 / 7 = <<56/7=8>>8 pints of blood per day.\nFinally, we divide the amount of blood needed each day by the amount of blood the vampire sucks per person: 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 people.

If he sucks 2 pints of blood per person, how many people does he need to suck each day to survive?\n\nThere are 8 pints in a gallon. So to survive, the vampire needs to suck: \n7 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = <<7*8=56>>56 pints of blood per week.\n\nTo figure out how many pints of blood the vampire needs to suck each day, we divide the weekly requirement by 7 (days in a week):\n56 pints/7 days = <<56/7=8>>8 pints of blood per day.\n\nSince the vampire sucks 2 pints of blood per person, he needs to suck:\n8 pints/day \u00f7 2 pints/person = <<8/2=4>>4 people per day.

Therefore, each week they consume a total of 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 people.\nIf they consume 8 people every week, a village of 72 people will last them 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 weeks.
