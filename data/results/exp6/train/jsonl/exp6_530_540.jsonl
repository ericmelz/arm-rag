Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?\n\nThe first spacecraft traveled the 448 miles in 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, for a speed of 448/0.5=<<448/0.5=896>>896 mph.\nThe second spacecraft traveled the same distance, 448 miles, in 30+30=<<30+30=60>>60 minutes or 1 hour.\nTherefore, the speed of the second spacecraft was 448/1=<<448/1=448>>448 mph.\nThe difference in speed between the two spacecraft is 896-448=<<896-448=448>>448 mph.

Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?\n\nThe first spacecraft traveled for 30 minutes, or 30/60=<<30/60=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nThus, we have 448=0.5x for some unknown speed x.\nThis gives x=448/0.5=<<448/0.5=896>>896 mph.\nSince the second spacecraft landed thirty minutes later, it landed at 3:30+0:30=4:00 pm.\nThus, it traveled for 60 minutes, or 60/60=<<60/60=1>>1 hour.\nSince the distance is the same, this gives 448=1y for some unknown speed y.\nThis gives y=448/1=<<448/1=448>>448 mph.\nThe difference in speed is 896-448=<<896-448=448>>448 mph.

At full capacity, the vehicle can carry 300 family units with four people per family.  The space flight is expected to take years, and it is expected that the size of families will grow during the space voyage.  Therefore, when the spacecraft leaves the earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity.  How many people will be on the ship to start the journey?\n\nAt full capacity, the spacecraft can carry 300 family units * 4 people per family unit = <<300*4=1200>>1200 people.\nOne-third of the ship's capacity is 1200 people / 3 = <<1200/3=400>>400 people.\nTherefore, when the spacecraft leaves the Earth, there will be 400 people - 100 people = <<400-100=300>>300 people on board.

If the inexperienced sailors were paid $10 per hour for a 60-hour workweek, calculate the total combined monthly earnings of the experienced sailors.\n\nIf there were five inexperienced sailors, the number of experienced sailors is 17-5 = <<17-5=12>>12 sailors.\nIf each experienced sailor was paid 1/5 times more than the inexperienced sailors' $10, each experienced sailor was paid 1/5*$10+$10 = $10 + $2 = $<<1/5*10+10=12>>12 per hour.\nIf the total hourly pay for experienced sailors is $12 per hour, each earns $12*60 = $<<12*60=720>>720 in a 60-hour workweek.\nThe monthly earnings for a sailor working for 720 in a 60-hour workweek are 720*4 = <<720*4=2880>>2880.\nThe total combined monthly earnings for the experienced sailors are 12*$2880 = $<<12*2880=34560>>34560.

But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\n\nThe ship sailed halfway to the destination, so the total distance for the whole journey is 2 * (1/2) = <<2*(1/2)=1>>1.\nThe ship was blown one-third of the way to the destination, so the distance blown is 1 * (1/3) = <<1*(1/3)=0.3333333333333333>>0.3333333333333333 of the total distance.\nThe distance blown in kilometers is therefore 0.3333333333333333 * 30 * 20 = <<0.3333333333333333*30*20=199.99999999999997>>199.99999999999997.

But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?\n\nIn the first part of the journey, the ship traveled east for a total distance of 20 hours * 30 kilometers per hour = <<20*30=600>>600 kilometers.\nIf the ship had sailed half the distance to the destination, then the total distance to the destination is 2 * 600 kilometers = <<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers.\nBut after the storm, the Skipper discovered that the ship had only traveled 1/3 of the distance to the destination, so the ship traveled 1200 kilometers / 3 = <<1200/3=400>>400 kilometers.\nThis means that the windstorm blew the ship 600 kilometers - 400 kilometers = <<600-400=200>>200 kilometers in the westward direction.

If Mitch needs to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, how many feet is the longest boat he can buy?\n\nMitch needs to keep $500 for licensing and registration fees and 3 * $500 = $<<500*3=1500>>1500 for docking fees.\nHe needs a total of $500+$1500 = $<<500+1500=2000>>2000 for the fees.\nThus, he can afford $20,000 - $2,000 = $<<20000-2000=18000>>18000 for the boat itself.\nSince a new boat costs $1500 per foot, he can buy a boat that is 18,000 / 1,500 = <<18000/1500=12>>12 feet long.

How much was the total reduction from the original selling price?\n\nThe price of the bag was reduced by $500 x 0.05 = $<<500*0.05=25>>25 after a week.\nSo, the selling price of the bag is $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.\nThe selling price of the bag was reduced by $475 x 0.04 = $<<475*0.04=19>>19 after a month.\nSo, the selling price of the bag is $475 - $19 = $<<475-19=456>>456.\nTherefore, the total reduction from the original selling price is $500 - $456 = $<<500-456=44>>44.

How much did she buy each bag for?\n\nLet the cost price of each bag be x.\nHence, the selling price per bag = $10\nProfit per bag = Selling price per bag - Cost price per bag = $10 - x\nTotal profit = Profit per bag * Number of bags sold in profit = ($10 - x) * 100\n$300 = ($10 - x) * 100\nDividing both sides by 100:\n$3 = $10 - x\nRearranging the equation:\nx = $10 - $3 = $7\nTherefore, Tilly bought each bag for $7.

Since the bag was still not sold, the selling price was reduced by 4% a month after. How much was the total reduction from the original selling price?\n\nThe original reduction from the price of the bag is $500 x 5/100 = $<<500*5/100=25>>25.\nSo, the bag is now priced at $500 - $25 = $<<500-25=475>>475.\nThe second reduction from the price of the bag is $475 x 4/100 = $<<475*4/100=19>>19.\nTherefore, the total reduction from the original selling price is $25 + $19 = $<<25+19=44>>44.

The rest were paper cups. How many pallets of paper cups did the store receive?\n\nHalf the pallets were paper towels, so the store received 20 is 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 pallets of paper towels.\nA quarter of the pallets were tissues, so the store received 20 is 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pallets of tissues.\nA fifth of the pallets were paper plates, so the store received 20 is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 pallets of paper plates.\nThe store received 20 - 10 - 5 - 4 = <<20-10-5-4=1>>1 pallet of paper cups.

If the sports store makes 20 sales and the music store makes 30 sales, how many customers are in each of the cars?\n\nLet's assume each car has an equal number of customers inside, represented by the variable x.\nIf there are 10 cars parked and each car has the same number of customers, the total number of customers will be 10*x = 10x.\nSince the sports store makes 20 sales and each customer makes 1 purchase, the total number of customers in the cars that made a purchase from the sports store is 20.\nSimilarly, the total number of customers in the cars that made a purchase from the music store is 30.\nTherefore, we have the equation 10x = 20 + 30.\nAdding the numbers on the right side gives 10x = 50.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 10 gives x = 50/10 = 5.\nTherefore, each of the cars has 5 customers inside.
