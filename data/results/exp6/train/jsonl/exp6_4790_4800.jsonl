In the fifth year, it will grow half as much as the fourth year.  When the tree is 5 years old, how tall is the tree?\n\nIn the second year, the tree will grow 2 feet * 50% = <<2*50*.01=1>>1 foot more than in the first year.\nThus, the tree will grow 2 feet + 1 foot = <<2+1=3>>3 feet in the second year.\nIn the third year, the tree will grow 3 feet * 50% = <<3*50*.01=1.5>>1.5 feet more than in the second year.\nThus, the tree will grow 3 feet + 1.5 feet = <<3+1.5=4.5>>4.5 feet in the third year.\nIn the fourth year, the tree will grow 4.5 feet * 2 = <<4.5*2=9>>9 feet.\nIn the fifth year, the tree will grow 9 feet / 2 = <<9/2=4.5>>4.5 feet.\nThus, the total height of the tree will be 2 feet + 3 feet + 4.5 feet + 9 feet + 4.5 feet = <<2+3+4.5+9+4.5=23>>23 feet.
