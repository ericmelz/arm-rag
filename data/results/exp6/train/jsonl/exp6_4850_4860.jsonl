If the peregrines eat 30% of the pigeons, how many pigeons are left?\n\nThere are a total of 40 pigeons nesting in Malcolm's skyscraper and each has 6 chicks, so there are 40 pigeons * 6 chicks = <<40*6=240>>240 pigeon chicks.\nThere are 240 pigeon chicks + 40 parent pigeons = <<240+40=280>>280 pigeons in total.\nIf the peregrine falcons eat 30% of the pigeons, that means they eat 30/100 * 280 pigeons = <<30/100*280=84>>84 pigeons.\nThe total number of pigeons left is 280 pigeons - 84 pigeons = <<280-84=196>>196 pigeons.

He again went up 7 floors and found that he is 9 floors away from the top of the building. How many floors does the building have?\n\nLet x be the number of floors in the building.\nAfter going up 5 floors, Earl is on the first floor + 5 = <<5+1=6>>6th floor.\nAfter going down 2 floors, Earl is on the 6th floor - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4th floor.\nAfter going up 7 floors, Earl is on the 4th floor + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11th floor.\nSince Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building, then x - 11 = 9.\nTherefore, the building has x = 9 + 11 = <<9+11=20>>20 floors.
