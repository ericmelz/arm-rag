If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12.

Together their heights equal 112 centimeters. How tall is Kirill in centimeters?\n\nLet's suppose that Kirill's brother's height is \"x\" centimeters.\nSince Kirill is 14 centimeters shorter than his brother, this means that his height is x - 14 centimeters.\nThe sum of their heights is equal to 112 centimeters, which can be represented by the equation x + (x - 14) = 112.\nCombining like terms, the equation becomes 2x - 14 = 112.\nBy adding 14 to both sides, the equation becomes 2x = 126.\nFinally, by dividing both sides by 2, the solution is x = 63.\nTherefore, Kirill's height is x - 14 = 63 - 14 = <<63-14=49>>49 centimeters.

How tall is Kirill in centimeters?\n\nLet's assume that Kirill's height is x centimeters.\nAccording to the problem, his brother's height is then x + 14 centimeters.\nTogether, their heights sum up to 112 centimeters, so the equation representing this relationship is x + (x + 14) = 112.\nBy simplifying the equation, 2x + 14 = 112.\nThen by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 112 - 14 = 98.\nFinally, by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 98/2 = <<98/2=49>>49.\nWe have found that Kirill is 49 centimeters tall.
