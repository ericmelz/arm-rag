The second sells the same computer for \u20ac920 with a 5% discount. What is the difference in price between the two stores?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discount for each device.\n\nIn the first store, the computer has a 6% discount, which means the discount is 950 * 0.06 = $<<950*0.06=57>>57.\n\nSo the final price in the first store is 950 - 57 = $<<950-57=893>>893.\n\nIn the second store, the computer has a 5% discount, which means the discount is 920 * 0.05 = \u20ac<<920*0.05=46>>46.\n\nSo the final price in the second store is 920 - 46 = \u20ac<<920-46=874>>874.\n\nThe difference in price between the two stores is 893 - 874 = $<<893-874=19>>19.

If the discount she received is $40, how much did she pay in total?\n\nLet X be the price without the discount.\nThe discount is X * 25% = $40.\nSo X = $40 / 25% = $40 / 0.25 = $<<40/0.25=160>>160.\nMaria paid $160 - $40 = $<<160-40=120>>120 in total.

How many boxes does Ms. Mosel fill each week?\n\nEach hen lays one egg per day, so the total number of eggs laid per day is 270 hens x 1 egg/hen = <<270*1=270>>270 eggs.\nMs. Mosel collects the eggs every morning, so she collects 270 eggs/day.\nTo calculate how many boxes of 6 eggs each she fills each week, we need to find out how many eggs she collects in a week first.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs collected in a week is 270 eggs/day x 7 days/week = <<270*7=1890>>1890 eggs.\nThen, we divide the total number of eggs (1890) by the number of eggs per box (6) to find the total number of boxes: 1890 eggs / 6 eggs/box = <<1890/6=315>>315 boxes.\nMs. Mosel fills 315 boxes of eggs each week.

On Wednesday she sells 2 fewer crates than Tuesday. On Thursday she sells half as many crates of eggs as she sells on Tuesday. How many total crates of eggs does she sell for the 4 days?\n\nOn Tuesday, she sells 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 crates of eggs.\nOn Wednesday, she sells 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 crates of eggs.\nOn Thursday, she sells 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 crates of eggs.\nTherefore, she sells a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 5 = <<5+10+8+5=28>>28 crates of eggs.
