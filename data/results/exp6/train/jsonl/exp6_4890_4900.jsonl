So, the three decided to push the car back into town, which was 10 miles away.  For the first three miles, Brad steered as Jim and Marcus pushed at a speed of 6 miles per hour.  Then, for the next 3 miles, Jim steered, as Brad and Marcus pushed at a speed of 3 miles per hour.  For the last four miles, Marcus steered as Brad and Jim pushed at a speed of 8 miles per hour.  How long did it take, in hours, to push the car back to town?\n\nFor the first 3 miles, it took Brad, Jim, and Marcus 3 / 6 = <<3/6=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nFor the next 3 miles, it took Jim, Brad, and Marcus 3 / 3 = <<3/3=1>>1 hour.\nFor the last 4 miles, it took Marcus, Brad, and Jim 4 / 8 = <<4/8=0.5>>0.5 hours.\nThus, in total, it took 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = <<0.5+1+0.5=2>>2 hours to push the car back to town.
