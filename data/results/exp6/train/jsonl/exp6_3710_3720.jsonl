If the average completion time of the last three students was 35 seconds, and the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, how long (in seconds) did it take the student who came first to finish the race?\n\nLet's assume that the first student took x seconds to finish the race.\nThe total time taken by the first student, second student, third student, and fourth student is x + 35 + 35 + 35 = 140 seconds.\nThe average time taken by the four students is 30 seconds.\nTherefore, x + 35 + 35 + 35 = 4 * 30 = 120 seconds.\nHence, x = 120 - 35 - 35 - 35 = <<120-35-35-35=15>>15 seconds.\nThe student who came first took 15 seconds to finish the race.

If the average completion time of the last three students was 35 seconds, and the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, how long (in seconds) did it take the student who came first to finish the race?\n\nLet's assume the time taken by the first student to complete the race is 'x' seconds.\n\nThe average completion time of all four runners is 30 seconds, so the total time taken by all four students is 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 seconds.\n\nThe average completion time of the last three students is 35 seconds, so the total time taken by the last three students is 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 seconds.\n\nThe time taken by the first student is the difference between the total time taken by all four students and the total time taken by the last three students, which is 120 - 105 = <<120-105=15>>15 seconds.\n\nTherefore, it took the first student 15 seconds to finish the race.

If the average completion time of the last three students was 35 seconds, and the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, how long (in seconds) did it take the student who came first to finish the race?\n\nLet's call the completion time of the first student x. \n\nThe total completion time for all four runners is 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 seconds. \n\nThe total completion time for the last three students is 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 seconds. \n\nSo the completion time of the first student is 120 - 105 - x = <<120-105-x=15-x>>15 - x.\n\nSince the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, we have the equation (105 + x) / 4 = 30.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 gives 105 + x = 120.\n\nSubtracting 105 from both sides gives x = 120 - 105 = <<120-105=15>>15.\n\nTherefore, it took the student who came first 15 seconds to finish the race.

If they keep up the same pace, how long combined will it take for them to run 5 miles each?\n\nIf the first friend takes 21 minutes to complete a 3-mile race, then his pace is 21 minutes / 3 miles = <<21/3=7>>7 minutes per mile.\nSimilarly, the second friend's pace is 24 minutes / 3 miles = <<24/3=8>>8 minutes per mile.\nTherefore, the combined time it would take for them to run 5 miles each is 7 minutes/mile * 5 miles + 8 minutes/mile * 5 miles = <<(7*5)+(8*5)=75>>75 minutes.

The English test has 50 questions and he gets 98% of them right. How many total questions does he get right?\n\nFor the math test, he gets 40 x 75/100 = <<40*75/100=30>>30 questions right.\nFor the English test, he gets 50 x 98/100 = <<50*98/100=49>>49 questions right.\nTherefore, he gets a total of 30 + 49 = <<30+49=79>>79 questions right.

The English test has 50 questions and he gets 98% of them right. How many total questions does he get right?\n\nOn the math test, Phillip gets 40 * .75 = <<40*.75=30>>30 questions right.\nOn the English test, he gets 50 * .98 = <<50*.98=49>>49 questions right.\nSo in total, he gets 30 + 49 = <<30+49=79>>79 questions right. Answer: \\boxed{79}.\n\n\nQuestion: Stacy is a high school Calculus teacher.  She assigns 45 problems for homework.  There are twice as many multiple choice problems as free response, and 7 more free response than true/false.  How many true/false questions are there?\n\nLet x represent the number of true/false questions.\nFree response:x+7\nMultiple Choice:2(x+7)\nTotal:x+x+7+2(x+7)=45\n4x+21=45\n4x=24\nx=<<6=6>>6 true/false questions. Answer: \\boxed{6}.\n\n\nQuestion: Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?\n", "text": "After 20 minutes, Georgia has completed 10/75 = 1/7 of the problems.\nAfter another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems, so she has completed 2 * 10 = 20 problems in total.\nIn 40 minutes, she has completed 10 + 20 = 30 problems.\nShe has 75 - 30 = 45 problems left to solve. Answer: \\boxed{45}."}
