For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?\n\nIf two cups of sugar is one part sugar, then one pound (16 ounces) of cream cheese is four parts cream cheese because 2 / .5 = <<2 /.5=4>>4\nThus 2 cups of sugar is 16 ounces of cream cheese because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16\nIf one teaspoon of vanilla is two eggs, then one teaspoon of vanilla is 2 / 2 = 1 egg.\nIf she used two cups of sugar, then she used 16 / 4 = <<16/4=4>>4 parts cream cheese\nThus, she used 4 * 1 = <<4*1=4>>4 teaspoons of vanilla.\nTherefore, she used 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 eggs. Answer: \\boxed{8}.\n\n\nQuestion: Perry made a recipe that serves four people. He added a half cup of cream at the end. Cream has 88 grams of fat per cup.
