On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\n\nLet's assume the number of students present in the class on the first day was x.\nThe number of students present in the class on the second day was x+40.\n\nThe number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day is twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day.\nIf 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick on the third day, then the number of students who didn't attend the class on the third day is 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40\n\nIf the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day is 40, then the number of students who didn't turn up on the second day is twice that number, or 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80.\n\nIn both of the two days, the total number of absentees is 40+80 = <<40+80=120>>120\nThe total number of students present on the first and second days is x+(x+40) = 2x+40\nSince the total number of students in the class is 280, the number of students present on the first and second days is 2x+40 = 280\n\nFrom the equation, 2x+40 = 280, the value of x is 280-40/2 = 240/2 = <<240/2=120>>120\nThe number of students absent on the first day is x, which is 120.\n\nThe total number of absentees in the three days is 120+120 = <<120+120=240>>240. Answer: \\boxed{240}.\n\n\nQuestion: Next year, there will be twice as many people going to the fair as are going this year, and the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. If the number of people going to the fair this year is 600, calculate the number of people at the fair in the three years.\n", "text": "This solution will use algebra to solve the problem.\n\nLet's assume the number of people going to the fair this year is x.\nAccording to the problem, next year there will be twice as many people going to the fair as are going this year. Therefore, the number of people going to the fair next year will be 2x.\nThe problem also states that the number of people who went to the fair last year was 200 less than those going next year. Therefore, the number of people who went to the fair last year is (2x - 200).\n\nTo find the total number of people at the fair in the three years, we add up the number of people going to the fair this year, the number of people going next year, and the number of people who went last year.\nSo, the total number of people at the fair in the three years is x + (2x - 200) + 2x.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we have:\nx + 2x - 200 + 2x\n= 5x - 200.\n\nWe are given that x = 600 (the number of people going to the fair this year).\nSubstituting x = 600 into the expression, we have:\n5(600) - 200\n= 3000 - 200\n= 2800.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people at the fair in the three years is 2800.\nAnswer: \\boxed{2800}."}

If you bought 8 chairs that were normally priced at $20, how much do the chairs cost in total?\n\nThe discounted price of the chairs is 20 * 0.25 = $<<20*0.25=5>>5 off\nSo the chairs cost 20 - 5 = $<<20-5=15>>15 each\nThe three extra chairs cost 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45\nThey get 1/3 off the discounted price of the three extra chairs, so they pay 45 * (1/3) = $<<45*(1/3)=15>>15 less\nThat means they pay 45 - 15 = $<<45-15=30>>30 for the extra chairs.\nThe five chairs cost 5* 15 = $<<5*15=75>>75\nSo in total the chairs cost 75 + 30 = $<<75+30=105>>105.

After giving the cashier $130, Jude got a $4 change. How much did each of the chairs cost?\n\nThe total amount spent for two sets of plates is $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.\nThe total amount spent for the table and two sets of plates is $50 + $40 = $<<50+40=90>>90.\nThe three chairs cost $130 - $4 - $90 = $<<130-4-90=36>>36.\nTherefore, the cost of each chair is $36/3 = $<<36/3=12>>12.

If Manny wants to buy one portable table and two chairs, how much will be left in his $100?\n\nThe cost of one plastic chair is $55/5 = $<<55/5=11>>11.\nSo the cost of three plastic chairs is $11 x 3 = $<<11*3=33>>33.\nTherefore, the cost of one portable table is $33.\nManny will spend $33 + (2 x $11) = $<<33+(2*11)=55>>55.\nThus, $100 - $55= $<<100-55=45>>45 will be left in his $100. Answer: \\boxed{45}.\n\n\nQuestion: Three plastic chairs cost as much as a portable table. Five plastic chairs cost $55. If Manny wants to buy one portable table and two chairs, how much will be left in his $100?\n\nSince five plastic chairs cost $55, one plastic chair costs $55/5 = $<<55/5=11>>11.\nTherefore, three plastic chairs amount to $11 x 3 = $<<11*3=33>>33.\nSo, the portable table costs $33.\nHence, a portable table and two chairs cost $33 + 2 x $11 = $<<33+2*11=55>>55.\nThus, Manny will have $100 - $55 = $<<100-55=45>>45 left in his $100.

What percentage of the initial cost did she lose?\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of money she lost. We do this by subtracting the amount she sold it for from the amount that she bought it for: $300 - $255 = $<<300-255=45>>45.\nNext, we need to determine what percentage of $300 is $45. We do this by dividing the amount she lost by the initial cost and multiplying by 100: ($45 / $300) * 100% = 15%.

He bought 200 units for just $3000, and he wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits when all units are sold. Including the profit margin, what will be the selling price for each phone?\n\nThe initial cost per unit is $3000/200 units = $<<3000/200=15>>15/unit.\nThe desired profit per unit is $15/unit * (1/3) = $<<15*1/3=5>>5.\nSo the selling price per unit is $15/unit + $5/unit = $<<15+5=20>>20/unit.
