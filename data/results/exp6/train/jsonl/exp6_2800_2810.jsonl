If Rob leaves his home at 11 a.m., at what time should Mark leave his home so that they both arrive at the same time?\n\nIf it takes Rob 1 hour to get to the national park, then Mark takes 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours to get to the national park.\nIf Rob leaves his home at 11 a.m., he will arrive at the national park at 11 + 1 = <<11+1=12>>12 p.m.\nFor both to arrive at the same time, Mark should leave his house at 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 a.m. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Rob planned on spending three hours reading in preparation for his literature exam. If he ends up spending only three-quarters of this time reading, and he reads a page every fifteen minutes, how many pages did he read in this time?\n\nRob initially planned to read for three hours, which is equal to 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.\nHowever, he ended up reading only 3/4 * 180 = <<3/4*180=135>>135 minutes.\nIf he reads a page every 15 minutes, Rob would be able to read a total of 135 / 15 = <<135/15=9>>9 pages. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Rob planned on spending three hours reading in preparation for his literature exam. If he ends up spending only three-quarters of this time reading, and he reads a page every fifteen minutes, how many pages did he read in this time?\n\nThree quarters of three hours is (3/4)*3 = <<3/4*3=2.25>>2.25 hours.\nIn 2.25 hours, the number of minutes Rob spends reading is 2.25*60 = <<2.25*60=135>>135 minutes.\nSince he reads a page every 15 minutes, in 135 minutes Rob reads 135/15 = <<135/15=9>>9 pages.

Her house is currently worth $400,000. The city is about to build a new high-speed rail project nearby, which will increase her house's value by 25%. Jenny can only afford to spend $15,000/year on property tax. How many dollars worth of improvements can she make to her house before her property tax bill gets too high?\n\nFirst find the value of the increase in Jenny's house's value: $400,000 * 25% = $<<400000*25*.01=100000>>100,000\nNow add that amount to the current value of her house to find the new value: $400,000 + $100,000 = $<<400000+100000=500000>>500,000\nNow multiply that amount by Jenny's property tax rate to find her annual property tax bill: $500,000 * 2% = $<<500000*2*.01=10000>>10,000.\nNow subtract that amount from Jenny's budget to find how much she can spend on property tax: $15,000 - $10,000 = $<<15000-10000=5000>>5,000.\nNow divide that amount by Jenny's property tax rate to find how much her property value can change: $5,000 / 2% = $<<5000/2*.01=250000>>250,000.\nNow subtract the value of her house to find how much she can spend on improvements: $250,000 - $500,000 = $<<250000-500000=-250000>>-250,000.

How many dollars worth of improvements can she make to her house before her property tax bill gets too high?\n\nFirst find the increase in the house's value: $400,000 * 25% = $<<400000*25*.01=100000>>100,000\nThen add that amount to the original value of the house to find its new value: $100,000 + $400,000 = $<<100000+400000=500000>>500,000\nBecause Jenny pays 2% of her house's value in property tax, she will pay $500,000 * 2% = $<<500000*2*.01=10000>>10,000/year on property tax once the rail project is built.\nJenny wants to make $15,000 - $10,000 = $<<15000-10000=5000>>5,000 worth of improvements to her house.\nSince each dollar of improvements increases Jenny's property tax bill by 2 cents, she can make $5,000 / .02 = $250,000 of improvements before her tax bill gets too high.

Each person pays $50 for the ticket and $10 for their entr\u00e9e, and half the people also buy unlimited drink tickets for $30/person. Then the dinner theater is canceled due to COVID, and each person gets a 90% refund. How much money did the group of six friends lose?\n\nThe cost of the tickets for the group is 6 * $50 = $<<6*50=300>>300.\nThe cost of the dinner for the group is 6 * $10 = $<<6*10=60>>60.\nHalf of the group buys the drink tickets, so 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 people.\nThe cost of the drink tickets for those three people is 3 * $30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.\nThe total cost for the group is $300 + $60 + $90 = $<<300+60+90=450>>450.\nThe group gets a 90% refund, so they lose 100% - 90% = 10% of the money.\nThe group lost 10% * $450 = $<<10*.01*450=45>>45.
