How many men does he employ if there are 20 fewer men than women and 180 people working for Lauryn?\n\nLet's call the number of women employed by Lauryn as \"W\" and the number of men as \"M.\"\nSince there are 20 fewer men than women, we can express this relationship as M = W - 20.\nFurthermore, the total number of employees is given as 180, so we can write the equation W + M = 180.\nSubstituting M in terms of W in the second equation, we get W + (W - 20) = 180.\nCombining like terms, we get 2W - 20 = 180.\nAdding 20 to both sides of the equation, we get 2W = 200.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find that W = 100.\nSince W represents the number of women employed by Lauryn, there are 100 women in total.\nSubstituting this value into the equation M = W - 20, we find M = 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80.\nTherefore, Lauryn employs 80 men.

How much more would Janet make per month as a freelancer if there are four weeks in a month?\n\nJanet currently makes 30 * 40 = $<<30*40=1200>>1200 a week.\nJanet would make 40 * 40 = $<<40*40=1600>>1600 a week as a freelancer.\nJanet currently makes 1200 * 4 = $<<1200*4=4800>>4800 a month.\nJanet would make 1600 * 4 = $<<1600*4=6400>>6400 a month as a freelancer.\nJanet would pay 25 * 4 = $<<25*4=100>>100 a month in FICA taxes as a freelancer.\nJanet would pay 400 + 100 = $<<400+100=500>>500 a month in healthcare premiums as a freelancer.\nJanet would make 6400 - 500 = $<<6400-500=5900>>5900 a month as a freelancer after paying for FICA taxes and healthcare premiums.\nJanet would make 5900 - 4800 = $<<5900-4800=1100>>1100 more per month as a freelancer.

She get paid $30/hour at her current job, and would get paid $40/hour as a freelancer. However, she'd have to pay an extra $25 a week in FICA taxes plus $400/month in healthcare premiums. How much more would Janet make per month as a freelancer if there are four weeks in a month?\n\nFirst find how many hours Janet works per month by multiplying her weekly hours by the number of weeks per month: 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = <<40*4=160>>160 hours/month\nThen find how much more Janet would make per hour freelancing by subtracting her current hourly wage from her potential freelance hourly wage: $40/hour - $30/hour = $<<40-30=10>>10/hour\nThen multiply Janet's increased hourly wage by the number of hours she works per week to find how much more she makes per week: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $<<10*40=400>>400/week\nThen multiply Janet's increased weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month to find her increased monthly earnings before taxes: $400/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<400*4=1600>>1600/month\nThen find how much Janet pays in FICA taxes by multiplying her weekly extra income by the additional tax rate: $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<25*4=100>>100/month\nThen subtract Janet's healthcare premium and FICA taxes from her increased monthly income to find her total increase in monthly income: $1600/month - $400/month - $100/month = $<<1600-400-100=1100>>1100/month. Answer: \\boxed{1100}.\n\n\nQuestion: Janet is getting paid to moderate social media posts. She gets paid 25 cents per post she checks. If it takes her 10 seconds to check a post, how much does she earn per hour?\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60*60=<<60*60=3600>>3600 seconds in an hour.\nShe can check 3600/10=<<3600/10=360>>360 posts per hour.\nShe earns 360*$0.25=$<<360*0.25=90>>90 per hour. Answer: \\boxed{90}.\n\n\nQuestion: Janet is getting paid to moderate social media posts. She gets paid 25 cents per post she checks. If it takes her 10 seconds to check a post, how much does she earn per hour?\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 / 10 = <<60/10=6>>6 sets of 10 seconds in a minute.\nSo, Janet earns $0.25 x 6 = $<<0.25*6=1.50>>1.50 in a minute.\nTherefore, she earns $1.50 x 60 = $<<1.5*60=90>>90 per hour.
