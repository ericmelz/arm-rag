What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?\n\nLet x be the sum of Lizette's scores in her first two quizzes.\nSo her average in the first two quizzes is x/2.\nThe sum of her scores in the first three quizzes is x + 92.\nHer average in all three quizzes is (x + 92)/3 = 94.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get x + 92 = 282.\nSubtracting 92 from both sides, we get x = 190.\nSo her average in the first two quizzes is 190/2 = <<190/2=95>>95. Answer: \\boxed{95}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?\n\nLet x be the average of Lizette's first two quizzes.\nHer total score on the first two quizzes is 2x.\nHer total score on the first three quizzes is 2x + 92.\nHer average score on the first three quizzes is (2x + 92) / 3 = 94.\nThus, 2x + 92 = 94 * 3 = 282.\nTherefore, 2x = 282 - 92 = 190.\nThus, the average of Lizette's first two quizzes, x, is 190 / 2 = <<190/2=95>>95. Answer: \\boxed{95}.\n\n\nQuestion: Malou got 91, 90, and 92 in her three quizzes. What is her average score?\n\nTo find the average score, add all the scores and divide it by the number of quizzes taken.\n\n91 + 90 + 92 = 273\n\n273 / 3 = <<273/3=91>>91\n\nHer average score is 91. Answer: \\boxed{91}.\n\n\nQuestion: Brittany got a 78 on her first test. After her second test, her average rose to an 81. What grade did she get on her second test?\n\nLet T be the grade Brittany got on her second test.\nHer average after the second test is (78 + T)/2 = 81.\n78 + T = 162\nT = <<84=84>>84. Answer: \\boxed{84}.\n\n\nQuestion: Malou got 91, 90, and 92 in her three quizzes. What is her average score?\n\nTo find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of quizzes. In this case, she got 91, 90, and 92 in three quizzes, so the average score is (91 + 90 + 92) / 3 = 273 / 3 = 91. Malou's average score is 91. Answer: \\boxed{91}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?\n", "text": "Let's assume Lizette's scores in her first two quizzes are x and y.\nHer total score in the first three quizzes is x + y + 92.\nHer average score in the first three quizzes is (x + y + 92)/3 = 94.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get x + y + 92 = 282.\nSubtracting 92 from both sides, we get x + y = 190.\nSo, Lizette's average in her first two quizzes is (x + y)/2 = 190/2 = <<190/2=95>>95.
