Jerry was in the pool for 3 minutes before becoming too cold to remain in the cold water.  Elaine stayed in the pool for twice as long as Jerry.  George could only stay in the pool for one-third as long as Elaine.  And Kramer, who accidentally locked himself in the bathroom, could not find the pool.  What is the combined total of minutes that Jerry and his friends were in the cold water?\n\nElaine stayed in the pool for twice as long as Jerry, so she stayed in for 3 minutes * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 minutes.\nGeorge stayed in the pool for one-third as long as Elaine, so he stayed in for 6 minutes / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 minutes.\nKramer, unfortunately, did not take a dip in the cold water, so his time in the pool is 0 minutes.\nThe combined total of minutes for Jerry and his friends is 3 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes + 0 minutes = <<3+6+2+0=11>>11 minutes.

The teacher is allowed in for free. If the class has a budget of $350, how many students can go on the field trip?\n\nLet's assume the number of students that can go on the field trip is \"x\".\nThe total cost of admission for the students is $10 * x.\nThe total cost of the field trip, including the bus rental and admission for students, is $100 + $10 * x.\nConsidering the teacher goes for free, the total cost of the field trip must be below the class's budget, so $100 + $10 * x <= $350.\nSubtracting $100 from both sides, we get $10 * x <= $250.\nDividing both sides by $10, we get x <= 25.\nTherefore, the class can take a maximum of 25 students on the field trip.
