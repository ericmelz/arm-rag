Answer: \\boxed{810}.\n\n\nQuestion: A frog lays 800 eggs a year.  10 percent dry up, and 70 percent are eaten.  1/4 of the remaining eggs end up hatching, how many frogs hatch out of the 800?\n", "text": "10% of the eggs dry up, so 10% of 800 is 0.10*800 = <<10*.01*800=80>>80 eggs.\n70% of the eggs are eaten, so 70% of 800 is 0.70*800 = <<70*.01*800=560>>560 eggs.\nIf we subtract the eggs that dry up and the eggs that are eaten from the total number of eggs, we get 800-80-560 = <<800-80-560=160>>160 eggs remaining.\n1/4 of the remaining eggs hatch, so 1/4 of 160 is 160*(1/4) = <<160*(1/4)=40>>40 frogs hatch.

He spends 5 hours in the studio, where he writes, records, and edits his songs. Each song takes 12 minutes to record, then it takes 30 minutes to edit all of his songs.   How many minutes did it take Elvis to write each song, if each song took the same amount of time to write?\n\nElvis spent 5 hours x 60 minutes = <<5*60=300>>300 minutes in the studio.\nHe spent 12 minutes x 10 songs = <<12*10=120>>120 minutes recording his songs.\nHe spent 30 minutes editing his songs.\nThus, he spent a total of 120 minutes + 30 minutes = <<120+30=150>>150 minutes writing and editing his songs.\nTherefore, it took Elvis 300 minutes - 150 minutes = <<300-150=150>>150 minutes to write his 10 songs.\nHence, it took Elvis 150 minutes / 10 songs = <<150/10=15>>15 minutes to write each song.

How many minutes did it take Elvis to write each song, if each song took the same amount of time to write?\n\nFirst find the total time spent recording: 10 songs * 12 minutes/song = <<10*12=120>>120 minutes\nThen add that time to the editing time to find the total production time: 120 minutes + 30 minutes = <<120+30=150>>150 minutes\nThen subtract the total production time in minutes from the total time Elvis spent in the studio to find the writing time: 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour - 150 minutes = <<5*60-150=150>>150 minutes\nThen divide the total writing time by the number of songs to find the per-song writing time: 150 minutes / 10 songs = <<150/10=15>>15 minutes/song.

How many minutes did it take Elvis to write each song, if each song took the same amount of time to write?\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time spent in the studio to minutes. Elvis spends 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<5*60=300>>300 minutes in the studio.\nNext, subtract the time spent recording and editing from the total studio time: 300 minutes - 30 minutes - 10 songs * 12 minutes/song = <<300-30-10*12=150>>150 minutes.\nFinally, divide the total minutes spent writing by the number of songs to find the time spent writing each song: 150 minutes / 10 songs = <<150/10=15>>15 minutes/song.
