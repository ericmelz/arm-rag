And each time he fires his weapon, his power-fire setting allows him to shoot a flame for 5 seconds.  On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?\n\nTo find the number of seconds per minute that Jason shoots flames, we need to divide the total time of shooting flames by the average time between shots.\nFirst, we need to calculate the average time Jason spends not firing his weapon. Since he fires every 15 seconds, this means he spends 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 seconds not firing.\nThe proportion of time spent firing is 5/15 or 1/3 of the time.\nTherefore, Jason shoots flames for 1/3*60=<<1/3*60=20>>20 seconds per minute.

On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?\n\nTo find the average number of seconds per minute that Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard, we need to find the total time he shoots flames in a minute.\n\nSince Jason shoots flames every 15 seconds, he shoots flames 60/15 = <<60/15=4>>4 times in a minute.\n\nEach time Jason shoots flames, he shoots for 5 seconds, so the total time he shoots flames in a minute is 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 seconds.\n\nTherefore, on average, Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard for 20 seconds per minute.

We know that s = 6r and s + r = 84.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 6r + r = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7r = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get r = 12.

In the first week she kept her commitment with the exception of one day when she saved only a quarter of this amount. How much has she saved at the end of this week?\n\nDuring the first week, there are 7-1 = <<7-1=6>>6 days when Martha saved half of $12.\nThis means that she saved 6*($12/2) = $<<6*(12/2)=36>>36 during those days.\nOn the seventh day, she saved only $12/4 = $3.\nThis means that at the end of the first week she saved together $36 + $3 = $<<36+3=39>>39.

In the first week she kept her commitment with the exception of one day when she saved only a quarter of this amount. How much has she saved at the end of this week?\n\nIn one week, there are 7 days.\nShe saves half of her allowance every day, so she saved 12 x 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 dollars for six days.\nBut on one of the days, she saved only a quarter, so for the seventh day, she saved 12 x 0.25 = <<12*0.25=3>>3 dollars.\nHence, at the end of the week, she has saved 6 x 6 + 3 = <<6*6+3=39>>39 dollars.

In the first week she kept her commitment with the exception of one day when she saved only a quarter of this amount. How much has she saved at the end of this week?\n\nIn the first six days of the week, Martha saved $12/2 = $<<12/2=6>>6 each day.\nFor these six days, she managed to save $6 * 6 = $<<6*6=36>>36.\nOn the next day, Martha saved $12/4 = $<<12/4=3>>3.\nFor this day, she saved $3 * 1 = $<<3*1=3>>3.\nIn total, during the whole week, she managed to save $36 + $3 = $<<36+3=39>>39. Answer: \\boxed{39}.\n\n\nQuestion: Martha buys 1 latte for $4.00 every morning, 5 days a week.  3 days a week, she buys an iced coffee for $2.00.  Her goal for the entire year is to cut her coffee spending by 25%.  How much will she save?\n\nShe buys lattes 5 days a week so that's 5*4 = $<<5*4=20.00>>20.00 per week\nShe buys an iced coffee 3 days a week so that's 3*2 = $<<3*2=6.00>>6.00 per week\nSpends 20 for lattes and 6 for iced coffee so she spends 20+6 = $<<20+6=26.00>>26.00 per week\nIf she wants to cut her spending by 25% she needs to save .25 * 26 = $<<.25*26=6.50>>6.50 per week\nShe needs to save 6.50 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year so she needs to save 6.50*52 = $<<6.50*52=338.00>>338.00.
