He measures his speed on three trial runs and goes 36, 34, and 38 mph. How much faster does he have to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp?\n\nFirst add up all three speeds to find Timmy's total speed: 36 mph + 34 mph + 38 mph = <<36+34+38=108>>108 mph\nThen divide Timmy's total speed by 3 to find his average speed: 108 mph / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 mph\nThen subtract his average speed from his target speed to find how much faster he needs to go: 40 mph - 36 mph = <<40-36=4>>4 mph.

He measures his speed on three trial runs and goes 36, 34, and 38 mph. How much faster does he have to go than his average speed to make it up the ramp?\n\nFirst find the sum of Timmy's speeds: 36 mph + 34 mph + 38 mph = <<36+34+38=108>>108 mph\nThen divide the sum of the speeds by the number of speeds to find the average speed: 108 mph / 3 speeds = <<108/3=36>>36 mph\nNow subtract Timmy's average speed from the speed he needs to find how much faster he has to go: 40 mph - 36 mph = <<40-36=4>>4 mph.

Also inside is a riding lawnmower, a bicycle for Timmy as well as each of his parents, a tricycle for Timmy's little brother Joey, and a unicycle that Timmy's dad practices riding on.  How many wheels in total are in this garage?\n\nEach car has 4 wheels, so 2 cars * 4 wheels = <<2*4=8>>8 wheels.\nEach bicycle has 2 wheels, so the two parent's bicycles have 2 bikes * 2 wheels each = <<2*2=4>>4 wheels.\nSo far there is 8 car wheels + 4 adult bike wheels = <<8+4=12>>12 wheels.\nAdding in the bike for Timmy gives us 12 wheels + 2 wheels = <<12+2=14>>14 wheels.\nThen we add in the lawnmower for 14 wheels + 4 wheels = <<14+4=18>>18 wheels.\nAnd then we add Joey's tricycle for 18 wheels + 3 wheels = <<18+3=21>>21 wheels.\nThen we add Timmy's dad's unicycle to the sum total of 21 wheels + 1 wheel = <<21+1=22>>22 wheels in total.

Answer: \\boxed{250}.\n\n\nQuestion: John started weightlifting when he was 16.  When he first started he could Clean & Jerk 80 kg and he could Snatch 50 kg.  He manages to double his clean and jerk and increase his snatch by 80%.  What is his new combined total lifting capacity?\n\nHis clean and jerk went from 80 kg to 2*80 = <<80*2=160>>160 kg\nHis snatch increased by 50*.8 = <<50*.8=40>>40 kg\nSo his snatch is now 50+40 = <<50+40=90>>90 kg\nSo his combined total went from 80+50 = <<80+50=130>>130 kg\nHis new clean and jerk lift is 160 kg so his combined total is 160+90 = <<160+90=250>>250 kg.

He manages to double his clean and jerk and increase his snatch by 80%.  What is his new combined total lifting capacity?\n", "text": "His clean and jerk capacity doubles from 80 kg to 160 kg. \nHis snatch capacity increases by 80% of his original snatch weight, which is 50 kg. So, the increase is 50 kg * 0.8 = 40 kg. \nTherefore, his new snatch capacity is 50 kg + 40 kg = 90 kg. \nThe combined total lifting capacity is the sum of his new clean and jerk capacity and his new snatch capacity, which is 160 kg + 90 kg = 250 kg. \n\nAnswer: \\boxed{250}."}
