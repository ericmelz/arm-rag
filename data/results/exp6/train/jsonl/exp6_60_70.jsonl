How much money has Jeremy if, before the purchase, he had two times more money, than the cost of the computer itself?\n\nThe accessories cost 3000 * 10/100 = $<<3000*10/100=300>>300.\nJeremy had 3000 * 2 = $<<3000*2=6000>>6000 before he made the purchase.\nSo he has 6000 - 3000 - 300 = $<<6000-3000-300=2700>>2700. Answer: \\boxed{2700}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tara has been planning to buy a laptop which costs $1000. A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will her balance be after paying for 4 months?\n", "text": "The down payment is 1000 x 20/100 = $200.\nSo Tara will pay a total of $200 + $20 = $220 for the down payment.\nHer balance after the down payment is $1000 - $220 = $780.\nSo, Tara has to pay $65 x 4 = $260 after 4 months.\nTherefore, Tara's balance will be $780 - $260 = $520.

The second week, she runs twice as long plus 3 extra miles per week. The third week she runs 9/7 as much as she ran the second week. The week after that, she sprains her ankle and has to reduce her running time by 5 miles per week. How many miles did she run the week she was injured?\n\nThe second week she runs 2 * 2 + 3 = <<2*2+3=7>>7 miles.\nThe third week she runs 7 * 9/7 = <<7*9/7=9>>9 miles.\nHer running time was reduced by 5 from the third week, so she ran 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 miles the week she was injured.
