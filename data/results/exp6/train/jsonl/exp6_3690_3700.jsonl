On Friday, she paid her electricity and internet bills which were $117 and $100, respectively. Then on Saturday, she paid her phone bill, $70. How much money is left in Liza's account?\n\nLiza had $800 - $450 = $<<800-450=350>>350 left on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Liza deposited her paycheck, so her total amount became $350 + $1500 = $<<350+1500=1850>>1850.\nAfter paying her electricity, the remaining sum would be $1850 - $117 = $<<1850-117=1733>>1733.\nThus, after payment for the internet, Liza's bank balance would be $1733 - $100 = $<<1733-100=1633>>1633.\nBy deducting the phone bill on Saturday, Liza would have $1633 - $70 = $<<1633-70=1563>>1563.

How many weeks before Carol and Mike both have the same amount of money?\n\nLet $w$ be the number of weeks before Carol and Mike both have the same amount of money. We can create the equation $60+9w=90+3w$. This equation represents the fact that Carol's money and Mike's money will be the same in $w$ weeks. Simplifying the equation, we have $6w=30$. Solving this equation, we find that $w=\\boxed{5}$.\n\n\nQuestion: Carol has $60 and saves $9 per week. Mike has $90 and saves $3 per week. How many weeks before Carol and Mike both have the same amount of money?\n\nWe begin by setting up an equation to represent the situation. Let $w$ represent the number of weeks that have passed.\n\nCarol's amount of money, $C$, can be represented as:\n\n$C = 60 + 9w$.\n\nMike's amount of money, $M$, can be represented as:\n\n$M = 90 + 3w$.\n\nWe want $C$ to equal $M$, so we set up the equation:\n\n$60 + 9w = 90 + 3w$.\n\nSubtracting $3w$ from both sides, we have:\n\n$6w = 90 - 60$.\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n$6w = 30$.\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we have:\n\n$w = \\frac{30}{6} = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThus, Carol and Mike will both have the same amount of money after 5 weeks.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom receives a $12 allowance per month.

The wallet is $60 more than the cost of the food, on which Mike spent $30. How much did Mike spend that day on the shopping?\n\nThe wallet cost is 60 + 30 = $<<60+30=90>>90.\nThe shirt cost 90 / 3 = $<<90/3=30>>30.\nSo Mike spent 30 + 30 + 90 = $<<30+30+90=150>>150 on the shopping.
