How old will Joel be when his dad is twice as old as him?\n\nLet's assume it will take x years for Joel's dad to be twice as old as Joel.\nAt present, Joel's dad is 32 years old, so in x years, he will be 32 + x years old.\nCurrently, Joel is 5 years old, so in x years, he will be 5 + x years old.\nAccording to the problem's statement, Joel's dad will be twice as old as Joel in x years, so we can write an equation: 32 + x = 2 * (5 + x)\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get: 32 + x = 10 + 2x\nSubtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get: 32 = 10 + x\nSubtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get: 22 = x\nTherefore, when Joel's dad is twice as old as Joel, Joel will be 5 + 22 = <<5+22=27>>27 years old.

How old will Joel be when his dad is twice as old as him?\n\nLet's assume x is the number of years that will pass before Joel's dad is twice as old as Joel.\nAfter x years, Joel will be 5 + x years old.\nAfter x years, Joel's dad will be 32 + x years old.\nSince Joel's dad will be twice as old as Joel after x years, the equation is 2(5 + x) = 32 + x.\nSimplifying the equation gives 10 + 2x = 32 + x.\nSubtracting x and 10 from both sides of the equation gives x = 22.\nTherefore, Joel will be 5 + 22 = <<5+22=27>>27 years old when his dad is twice as old as him.

How old will Joel be when his dad is twice as old as him?\n\nLet x be the number of years until Joel's dad is twice as old as Joel.\nWhen x years pass, Joel will be 5 + x years old and his dad will be 32 + x years old.\nBy setting up an equation, we get: 32 + x = 2(5 + x)\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get: 32 + x = 10 + 2x\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get: 32 = 10 + x\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 22 = x\nTherefore, Joel will be 5 + 22 = <<5+22=27>>27 years old when his dad is twice as old as Joel.
