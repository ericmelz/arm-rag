If the number of cars on the highway is twice the number of trucks, find out the total number of trucks on the highway?\n\nLet's say the number of trucks on the highway is t.\nThe number of cars on the highway is 2t.\nThe total number of vehicles on the highway is t+2t = 3t = 300\nTherefore, the total number of trucks on the highway is t = 300/3 = <<300/3=100>>100. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: On a highway, the total number of vehicles passing is 300. If the number of cars on the highway is twice the number of trucks, find out the total number of trucks on the highway?\n\nLet's assume the number of trucks on the highway is x.\nSince the number of cars on the highway is twice the number of trucks, then the number of cars is 2x.\nTherefore, the total number of vehicles on the highway is x + 2x = 3x.\nWe can express this algebraically as:\n3x = 300\nTo find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\nx = 300/3\nx = 100\nTherefore, there are 100 trucks on the highway. Answer: \\boxed{100}.\n\n\nQuestion: On a highway, the total number of vehicles passing is 300. If the number of cars on the highway is twice the number of trucks, find out the total number of trucks on the highway?\n\nLet's assume the number of trucks on the highway is x.\nThe number of cars on the highway is 2x.\nThe total number of vehicles on the highway is x + 2x = 300.\nCombining like terms, we get 3x = 300.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 100.\nTherefore, the total number of trucks on the highway is 100.
