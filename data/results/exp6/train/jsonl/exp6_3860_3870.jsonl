How many miles did she bike on Monday?\n\nLet X be the number of miles Mona bikes on Monday.\nShe bikes 2*X miles on Saturday.\nMona bikes 12 + 2*X + X = 3*X + 12 = 30 miles per week.\nThus, 3*X = 18 miles.\nThus, X = <<6=6>>6 miles.

Over the course of the day, he sold 10 bicycles and bought an additional 15 to fix up. On Saturday, he sold 12 bicycles and bought 8 more. And on Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. What was the net increase in the number of bicycles in stock in Hank's store over the three days?\n\nOver the three days, Hank sold 10 + 12 + 9 = <<10+12+9=31>>31 bicycles.\nHe bought 15 + 8 + 11 = <<15+8+11=34>>34 bicycles over the three days.\nThus, there was a net increase in the number of bicycles in stock of 34 - 31 = <<34-31=3>>3 bicycles.
