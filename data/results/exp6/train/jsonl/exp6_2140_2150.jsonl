They were each going to do the long jump, triple jump, and high jump to see who had the highest average jump. The first athlete jumped 26 feet in the long jump, 30 feet in the triple jump, and 7 feet in the high jump. The second athlete jumped 24 feet in the long jump, 34 feet in the triple jump, and 8 feet in the high jump. What was the average jump of the winner?\n\nTo find the average jump, we need to find the total distance jumped and divide it by the number of jumps. \nFirst athlete's total distance: 26 feet + 30 feet + 7 feet = <<26+30+7=63>>63 feet\nSecond athlete's total distance: 24 feet + 34 feet + 8 feet = <<24+34+8=66>>66 feet\nSo the winner had a total distance of 66 feet.
