If they both watched six of the same videos, what's the total number of hours they watched?\n", "text": "Lila watches the video at two times the average speed, so it takes her 100 hours / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 hours to watch one video.\nIf Lila and Roger both watched six of the same videos, the total number of hours Lila watched is 6 videos * 50 hours/video = <<6*50=300>>300 hours.\nSince Roger watched the videos at the average speed, he watched 6 videos * 100 hours/video = <<6*100=600>>600 hours in total.\nTherefore, the total number of hours they both watched is 300 hours + 600 hours = <<300+600=900>>900 hours. Answer: \\boxed{900}."}
