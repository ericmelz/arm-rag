Gordonia has 1/2 times the total population in the three cities. If the population of Toadon is 60 percent of Gordonia's population, how many people live in Lake Bright?\n\nLet X be the population of Lake Bright.\nThe population of Gordonia is 80000 / 2 = <<80000/2=40000>>40000 people.\nThe population of Toadon is 60/100 * 40000 = <<60/100*40000=24000>>24000 people.\nThe total population for Toadon, Gordonia, and Lake Bright is X + 40000 + 24000 = 80000.\nCombining like terms, we get X + 64000 = 80000.\nSubtracting 64000 from both sides, we get X = 80000 - 64000 = <<80000-64000=16000>>16000 people.

After that 1/8 of the population gets pregnant and 1/4 of those people have twins.  How many people are there after the births?\n\nThe population increased by 50,000-30,000=<<50000-30000=20000>>20,000\nSo the population becomes 300,000+20,000=<<300000+20000=320000>>320,000\n320,000/8=<<320000/8=40000>>40,000 people get pregnant.\n40,000/4=<<40000/4=10000>>10,000 people have twins.\nSo they have 40,000+10,000=<<40000+10000=50000>>50,000 people have children.\nThat means the population becomes 320,000+50,000=<<320000+50000=370000>>370,000 people.
