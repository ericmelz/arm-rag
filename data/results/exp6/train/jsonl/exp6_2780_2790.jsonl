That week Remi refills the bottle 3 times a day and drinks the whole bottle each time except for twice when he accidentally spills 5 ounces the first time and 8 ounces the second time. In 7 days how many ounces of water does Remi drink?\n", "text": "Remi refills the water bottle 3 times a day, so he refills it 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 times in a week.\nEach refill is 20 ounces, so he would drink a total of 20 * 21 = <<20*21=420>>420 ounces if he didn't spill any.\nHowever, he spills a total of 5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13 ounces.\nTherefore, Remi drinks 420 - 13 = <<420-13=407>>407 ounces of water in a week.

What score does she need to get on a fourth test so that her average score for the four tests is exactly 85?\n\nTo find the average score of the four tests, we need to divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores. \n\nThe sum of Maria's scores on the first three tests is 80 + 70 + 90 = 240.\n\nTo find the average score, we divide the sum (240) by the number of tests (4): 240 / 4 = 60.\n\nMaria needs a total of 85 on the 4 tests.\n\nLet x be the score Maria needs on the fourth test.\n\nThe sum of Maria's scores on the four tests will be 240 + x.\n\nThe average score for the four tests is 85, so (240 + x) / 4 = 85.\n\nWe can solve the equation (240 + x) / 4 = 85 for x by multiplying both sides by 4: 240 + x = 340.\n\nSubtracting 240 from both sides, we find x = 340 - 240 = <<100=100>>100.\n\nThus, Maria needs to get a score of 100 on the fourth test to have an average score of exactly 85 for the four tests.
