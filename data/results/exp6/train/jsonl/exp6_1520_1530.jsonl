If the baker wants to use up the 6 cups of flour he has remaining in his pantry, how many eggs will he need to use?\n\nIf the recipe calls for 3 eggs for every 2 cups of flour, then the ratio of eggs to flour is 3/2.\nTo find out how many eggs the baker needs to use for the 6 cups of flour, we need to set up a proportion with the given ratio.\n\nLet x represent the number of eggs the baker needs to use.\nThen, we can set up the proportion: x/6 = 3/2.\n\nCross-multiplying, we get: x*2 = 6*3.\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 18.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 9.\n\nTherefore, the baker will need to use 9 eggs.

To find out how many eggs the baker will need, we set up a proportion: 3 eggs / 2 cups of flour = x eggs / 6 cups of flour.\n\nCross-multiplying, we get 2x = 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that the baker will need x = 18 / 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 eggs.
