Farmer Brenda grows 6 acres of corn, 7 acres of cotton, and 14 acres of beans. Farmer Bernie grows 2 acres of corn and 12 acres of cotton. If corn takes 20 gallons of water an acre, cotton takes 80 gallons of water an acre, and beans take twice as much water as corn, what percentage of the total water used will go to Farmer Bob's farm?\n", "text": "To find the total water used for Farmer Bob's corn, we multiply the water use per acre (20 gallons) by the number of acres (3): 20 gallons/acre * 3 acres = 60 gallons.\nFor Farmer Bob's cotton, the calculation is: 80 gallons/acre * 9 acres = 720 gallons.\nFor Farmer Bob's beans, we need to account for the fact that beans require twice as much water as corn. Thus, the calculation is: 2 * 20 gallons/acre * 12 acres = 480 gallons.\nAdding up all three amounts, we find that Farmer Bob will use a total of 60 gallons + 720 gallons + 480 gallons = 1260 gallons.\nTo find the overall total water used, we need to calculate the total water used by the other two farmers as well. For Farmer Brenda, the calculations are: 20 gallons/acre * 6 acres = 120 gallons of corn, 80 gallons/acre * 7 acres = 560 gallons of cotton, and 2 * 20 gallons/acre * 14 acres = 560 gallons of beans. So Farmer Brenda will use a total of 120 gallons + 560 gallons + 560 gallons = 1240 gallons.\nFor Farmer Bernie, the calculations are: 20 gallons/acre * 2 acres = 40 gallons of corn and 80 gallons/acre * 12 acres = 960 gallons of cotton. So Farmer Bernie will use a total of 40 gallons + 960 gallons = 1000 gallons.\nAdding up the totals from all three farmers, we find that the overall total water used is 1260 gallons + 1240 gallons + 1000 gallons = 3500 gallons.\nFinally, to find the percentage of total water used by Farmer Bob, we divide the amount of water used by Farmer Bob (1260 gallons) by the overall total water used (3500 gallons) and multiply by 100%: 1260 gallons / 3500 gallons * 100% = 36%.

He needs to add 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. If he adds 900 ml of water, how much charcoal does he add?\n\nTo find out how much charcoal Jason needs to add, we can first determine the ratio of water to charcoal. This ratio is 30 ml of water for every 2 grams of charcoal.\n\nNext, we can divide the amount of water Jason is using (900 ml) by the ratio of water to charcoal:\n900 ml water / 30 ml water per 2 grams charcoal = 900/30 = <<900/30=30>>30 groups of 2 grams of charcoal.\n\nFinally, we can multiply the number of groups of charcoal (30) by the amount of charcoal in each group (2 grams) to find the total amount of charcoal needed:\n30 groups \u00d7 2 grams per group = <<30*2=60>>60 grams of charcoal.

If he pepper-sprays 84 animals total, how many raccoons does he pepper-spray?\n\nLet R be the number of raccoons Jason pepper-sprays and S be the number of squirrels. We know that R + S = 84 and S = 6R.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get R + 6R = 84\nCombining like terms, we get 7R = 84\nDividing both sides by 7, we get R = 12.
