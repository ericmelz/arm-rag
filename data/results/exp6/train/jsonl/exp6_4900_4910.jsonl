If Hiram is 40 years old, how old is Allyson?\n\nLet's represent Allyson's age as x.\nThe equation for the problem is 2x - 4 = Hiram's age + 12.\nFrom the problem, we know that Hiram's age is 40.\nSubstituting Hiram's age into the equation, we get 2x - 4 = 40 + 12.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 2x - 4 = 52.\nAdding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 56.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 28.\nTherefore, Allyson is 28 years old.

Forty percent of the cows on his farm have a red spot, 25 percent of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot and the remaining cows do not have any spot. How many cows on the farm have no spot?\n\nForty percent of 140 cows is (40/100)*140 =<<40/100*140=56>>56 cows.\nThe total number of cows without the red spot is 140-56 = <<140-56=84>>84 cows.\nThe number of cows with a blue spot is (25/100)*84 = <<25/100*84=21>>21 cows.\nThe total number of cows with a red or blue spot is 56+21 = <<56+21=77>>77 cows.\nThe number of cows on the farm with no spot is 140-77 = <<140-77=63>>63 cows.
