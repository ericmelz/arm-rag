Half of the class answered green, one-third of the girls answered pink, and the rest of the class answered yellow. If there are 18 girls in the class, how many students like yellow best?\n\nOut of the 30 students, half answered green which is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 students.\nOne-third of the girls answered pink. So, 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 girls answered pink.\nSo, 15 - 6 = <<15-6=9>>9 students answered yellow.

Half of the class answered green, one-third of the girls answered pink, and the rest of the class answered yellow. If there are 18 girls in the class, how many students like yellow best?\n\nOut of the 30 students in the class, half prefer green, or 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 students.\nThe girls constitute 18 of the 30 students, therefore 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 students are boys.\nIf the girls are 18, then the boys must be 30-18 = <<30-18=12>>12 students.\n1/3 of the girls, or 1/3*18 = <<1/3*18=6>>6 girls, prefer the color pink.\nThe rest of the girls, or 18-6 = <<18-6=12>>12 girls, like yellow.\nSince 30-15-6 = <<30-15-6=9>>9 students did not answer either green or pink, then 9/12 = <<9/12=0.75>>0.75, or 75%, of the boys did not answer.\nSince there are 12 boys, then 75% of 12 = (0.75)*12 = <<(0.75)*12=9>>9 boys like yellow the best.

Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer?\n\nTo calculate the monthly payment on the house, we need to divide the total cost of the house by the number of months in 20 years: $480,000 / (20*12) = $<<480000/(20*12)=2000>>2000 per month.\nTo calculate the monthly payment on the trailer, we need to divide the total cost of the trailer by the number of months in 20 years: $120,000 / (20*12) = $<<120000/(20*12)=500>>500 per month.\nThe monthly payment on the house is $2000 - $500 = $<<2000-500=1500>>1500 more than the trailer.

Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of monthly payments for each loan. Since both loans are paid off over 20 years, and there are 12 months in a year, there will be 20 * 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 monthly payments for each loan.\nNext, we need to calculate the monthly payment for each loan. To do this, we divide the total cost of the loan by the number of monthly payments. For the house loan, the monthly payment is $480,000 / 240 = $<<480000/240=2000>>2000. For the trailer loan, the monthly payment is $120,000 / 240 = $<<120000/240=500>>500.\nFinally, we subtract the monthly payment for the trailer loan from the monthly payment for the house loan to find the difference: $2000 - $500 = $<<2000-500=1500>>1500.\nTherefore, the monthly payment on the house is $1500 more than the monthly payment on the trailer.
