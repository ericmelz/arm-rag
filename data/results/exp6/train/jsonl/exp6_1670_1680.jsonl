If the river's width increases from this end uniformly by 2 yards every 10 meters along, and they row along the river at a rate of 5 m/s, how long (in seconds) will it take them to get to the point where the river is 80 yards wide?\n\nFirst find the rate the river's width increases per meter: 2 yards / 10 meters = .2 yards/meter\nThen subtract 50 yards from 80 yards to find how much the width increase: 80 yards - 50 yards = 30 yards\nThen divide the width increase by the rate of increase to find how long the trip across the river will take: 30 yards / .2 yards/meter = 150 meters\nThen divide the total distance traveled by the boat by its speed to find the total time: 150 meters / 5 m/s = <<150/5=30>>30 seconds.

It takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile.  How long, in hours, does it take to row the lake?\n\nEach side of the lake is 15 miles and he has to go around the whole thing so the distance is 15*4 = <<15*4=60>>60 miles\nHis swim speed is 1 mile per 20 minutes and he needs to go 60 miles so that's 60*20 = <<1*20*60=1200>>1,200 minutes\nJake rows twice the speed he swims so his rowing speed is 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 minutes per mile\nThe total distance around the lake is 60 miles and he rows 10 minutes per mile so it takes him 60*10 = <<60*10=600>>600 minutes\nThere are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he takes 600 minutes to row so that in hours is 600/60 = <<600/60=10>>10 hours.

He continued for another 15 miles at a constant speed, only stopping for a while for rest before covering the remaining 18 miles. What's the total distance covered by Emerson on his trip?\n\nWhen Emerson rowed the initial 6 miles, the total distance he rowed to cover the trip became 6 miles.\nHe continued 15 more miles, which added up to the total distance that Emerson rowed for the trip, which became 6+15 = <<6+15=21>>21 miles.\nEmerson then covered the remaining 18 miles to make a total of 21+18 = <<21+18=39>>39 miles.
