How many miles does he run?\n\nPaul runs for 2 * 1.5 = <<2*1.5=3>>3 hours.\nThree hours is equal to 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes.\nThus, he runs for 180 / 12 = <<180/12=15>>15 miles. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: While Paul watches movies, he runs on his treadmill. He can run a mile in 12 minutes. He watches two movies, which are an average length of 1.5 hours. How many miles does he run?\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, the movies are 1.5 x 60 = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes long each.\nSo, the total amount of time he spent watching them is 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 minutes.\nThus, he can run for 180/12 = <<180/12=15>>15 miles.

John's old computer used 800 watts and his new computer uses 50% more.  If the old price of electricity was 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, how much does his computer cost, in dollars, to run for 50 hours?\n\nHis new computer uses 800*.5=<<800*.5=400>>400 watts more than his old computer\nHis new computer uses 400+800=<<400+800=1200>>1200 watts\nThat means it uses 1200/1000=<<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2 kilowatts\nThe price of electricity went up by 12*.25=<<12*.25=3>>3 cents per kilowatt-hour\nSo it now costs 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 cents a kilowatt-hour\nSo it costs 15*.01=$.15 per kilowatt-hour\nSo he uses .15*1.2=<<.15*1.2=0.18>>0.18 dollars per hour\nSo it costs .18*50=$<<.18*50=9>>9. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: John uses a 75-watt electric fan for 8 hours a day. How much kWh of electric energy does he consume per month (30 days) for using the electric fan?\n\nTo calculate the kWh of electric energy John consumes per month, we need to multiply the power consumption in watts by the number of hours used per day and the number of days in a month.\n\nThe power consumption of John's electric fan is 75 watts.\n\nHe uses the fan for 8 hours each day.\n\nTherefore, he consumes 75 watts * 8 hours = <<75*8=600>>600 watt-hours (Wh) of electric energy per day.\n\nSince there are 30 days in a month, he consumes 600 Wh * 30 days = <<600*30=18000>>18000 watt-hours (or 18 kWh) of electric energy per month.

How much total money does he make?\n\nHe earns 12*5000=$<<12*5000=60000>>60,000 for the first 12 hours\nHe gets an increase of 5000*.2=$<<5000*.2=1000>>1000 per hour\nSo he gets 5000+1000=$<<5000+1000=6000>>6000 per hour\nThat means for the remaining 14 hours, he gets 14*6000=$<<14*6000=84000>>84,000\nSo his total income is 84,000+60,000=$<<84000+60000=144000>>144,000.

He ends up driving 50 miles out of the way and has to get back on track.  How long did the trip take if he kept the same speed?\n\nThe extra distance added 50*2=<<50*2=100>>100 miles\nSo his trip was 150+100=<<150+100=250>>250 miles\nThat means it took 250/150*3=<<250/150*3=5>>5 hours. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: John works 12 hours every other day.  He gets a 30% raise from his former $20 an hour job.  How much does he make in a 30 day month?\n\nHe works 30/2=<<30/2=15>>15 days\nSo he works 15*12=<<15*12=180>>180 hours\nHis pay is 20*1.3=$<<20*1.3=26>>26 an hour\nSo he makes 26*180=$<<26*180=4680>>4680.
