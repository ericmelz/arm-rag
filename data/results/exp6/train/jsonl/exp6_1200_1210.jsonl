In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the monthly driving cost for each apartment. \nFor the first apartment, the man will have to drive 31 miles per day, so the total monthly distance driven will be 31 miles/day * 20 days/month = <<31*20=620>>620 miles per month. The driving cost for the first apartment will therefore be 620 miles * $0.58/mile = $359.60.\nFor the second apartment, the man will have to drive 21 miles per day, so the total monthly distance driven will be 21 miles/day * 20 days/month = <<21*20=420>>420 miles per month. The driving cost for the second apartment will therefore be 420 miles * $0.58/mile = $243.60.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total monthly cost for each apartment, including rent, utilities, and driving cost.\nFor the first apartment, the total monthly cost will be $800 for rent + $260 for utilities + $359.60 for driving = $1419.60.\nFor the second apartment, the total monthly cost will be $900 for rent + $200 for utilities + $243.60 for driving = $1343.60.\n\nThe difference in total monthly costs is $1419.60 - $1343.60 = $<<1419.60-1343.60=76>>76.\nTherefore, the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments is $76.

If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?\n\nLet's assume that there were x lions in Londolozi at first.\nAfter 1 month, the number of lions will be x + 5 - 1 = x + 4\nAfter 2 months, the number of lions will be (x + 4) + 5 - 1 = x + 8\nAfter 3 months, the number of lions will be (x + 8) + 5 - 1 = x + 12\nAfter n months, the number of lions will be x + 4n\nAfter 1 year (12 months), the number of lions will be x + 4 * 12 = x + 48\nSince there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, x + 48 = 148\nSubtracting 48 from both sides of the equation, x = 148 - 48 = 100\nTherefore, there were 100 lions in Londolozi at first.
