Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Lilith originally had five dozen water bottles that she needed to sell at $2 each to get exactly enough money to buy her friend a birthday gift. However, at the store, Lilith realized she could not sell at $2 because the regular price was $1.85 per water bottle in her town, and she had to reduce her price to $1.85 as well to sell her water bottles. Calculate the total amount of money Lilith will have to find to buy her friend the birthday gift after selling her water bottles at the reduced cost.\n\nLilith had 5*12 = <<5*12=60>>60 water bottles.\nIf she sells them at $1.85 each and not $2, she will have to find $2 - $1.85 = $0.15 for each water bottle.\nThe total amount of money she will have to find for all the water bottles is $0.15*60 = $<<0.15*60=9>>9. Answer: \\boxed{9}.\n\n\nQuestion: Shelby had $20 to take to the book fair. She bought one book for $8 and another for $4. She decided to buy as many $4 posters as she could with the money she had left. How many posters can she buy?\n\nThe total cost of the books is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12.\nAfter buying the books, Shelby has $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8 left.\nThus, Shelby can buy $8/$4 = <<8/4=2>>2 posters.
