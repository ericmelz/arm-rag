Answer: \\boxed{325}.\n\n\nQuestion: On Thursday the Meat Market sold 210kg of ground beef. On Friday they sold twice that amount. On Saturday they only sold 130kg. On Sunday they sold half of what they sold Saturday. If they originally planned to sell only 500kg, how much meat did they sell beyond their original plans?\n\nOn Friday, the Meat Market sold 210 kg x 2 = <<210*2=420>>420 kg of ground beef.\nOn Sunday, they sold 130 kg / 2 = <<130/2=65>>65kg of ground beef.\nSo, the Meat Market sold a total of 210 kg + 420 kg + 130 kg + 65 kg = <<210+420+130+65=825>>825 kg.\nTherefore, they sold a total of 825 kg - 500 kg = <<825-500=325>>325 kg beyond their original plans. Answer: \\boxed{325}.\n\n\nQuestion: The owner of a Turkish restaurant wanted to prepare traditional dishes for an upcoming celebration. She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?\n\nLet X be the number of packages delivered by the third butcher.\nThus, the total number of packages delivered by the first butcher is 10 - X.\nAnd the total number of packages delivered by the second butcher is 7.\nAll these packages weigh 4 * (10 - X) + 4 * 7 + 4X = 100 pounds.\nThus, 40 - 4X + 28 + 4X = 100 pounds.\nThus, 68 = 100 pounds.\nThus, the third butcher delivered 100 - 68 = <<100-68=32>>32 pounds.\nTherefore, the third butcher delivered 32 / 4 = <<32/4=8>>8 packages.

If 1 foot of ribbon is left after Marissa uses 0.7 feet of ribbon to tie each box, find out how many boxes she tied?\n\nMarissa used 4.5 - 1 = <<4.5-1=3.5>>3.5 feet of ribbon to tie the boxes.\nSince she used 0.7 feet of ribbon to tie each box, she tied 3.5/0.7 = <<3.5/0.7=5>>5 boxes. Answer: \\boxed{5}.\n\n\nQuestion: Marissa has 4.5 feet of ribbon that she wants to use to tie some boxes. If 1 foot of ribbon is left after Marissa uses 0.7 feet of ribbon to tie each box, find out how many boxes she tied?\n\nLet the number of boxes, each requiring 0.7 feet of ribbon, that Marissa tied be x.\nThe total length of ribbon she used to tie the boxes is 0.7*x = 0.7x feet.\nThe length of ribbon remaining after tying x boxes is 4.5 - 0.7x.\nWe know this remaining length is 1 foot, therefore 4.5 - 0.7x = 1\nAdding 0.7x to both sides of the equation, we get 4.5 = 0.7x + 1\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get 4.5 - 1 = 0.7x+ 1 - 1\nThis simplifies to 3.5 = 0.7x\nDividing both sides by 0.7, we get 3.5/0.7 = 0.7x/0.7\nThis simplifies to 5 = x\nTherefore, Marissa tied 5 boxes.

She has found three clippings for each friend\u2019s pictures. It takes her six drops of glue to stick down each clipping. Lena has already glued her seven closest friends\u2019 pictures. How many drops of glue will she need for the newspaper clippings for her collage?\n\nSince Lena has already glued down her seven closest friends\u2019 pictures and she has 3 clippings for each friend, then she will need 7 * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 clippings for her collage.\nSince it takes 6 drops of glue to put down each clipping, then Lena will need 21 * 6 = <<21*6=126>>126 drops of glue for the newspaper clippings for her collage.
