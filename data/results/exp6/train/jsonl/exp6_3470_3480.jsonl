On average, how many seconds can she take to pick a weed if she wants to earn $10 an hour?\n\nTo determine how many seconds Heather can take to pick a weed, we need to calculate her earning per second. \n\nFirst, we need to determine her earnings per hour. Since she earns 5 cents per weed, and wants to earn $10 per hour, she needs to pick  $10 / $0.05 = 200 weeds per hour.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so Heather has 60 minutes x 60 seconds = <<60*60=3600>>3600 seconds in an hour.\n\nTherefore, she can take 3600 seconds / 200 = <<3600/200=18>>18 seconds to pick a weed.

For every photo he takes he earns $15. He sees a shark about every 10 minutes. His boat fuel costs $50 an hour. If he shark hunts for 5 hours, how much money can he expect to make in profit?\n\nFirst find the number of photos Pat takes in one hour: 60 minutes/hour / 10 minutes/photo = <<60/10=6>>6 photos\nThen find how many photos he takes in 5 hours: 6 photos/hour * 5 hours = <<6*5=30>>30 photos\nThen find how much money he makes in 5 hours by multiplying his per-photo earnings by the number of photos: 30 photos * $15/photo = $<<30*15=450>>450\nThen find how many hours Pat spends on fuel by multiplying the boat fuel cost per hour by the number of hours: $50/hour * 5 hours = $<<50*5=250>>250\nFinally, subtract the fuel cost from Pat's earnings to find his total profit: $450 - $250 = $<<450-250=200>>200.

If he shark hunts for 5 hours, how much money can he expect to make in profit?\n\nFor 5 hours, he would be hunting for 5*60=<<5*60=300>>300 minutes.\nIn 300 minutes, he would see 300/10=<<300/10=30>>30 sharks.\nThis would mean Pat would make 30*15=$<<30*15=450>>450 dollars.\nHis boat would cost 50*5=$<<50*5=250>>250.\nPat would therefore make 450-250=$<<450-250=200>>200 in profit.
