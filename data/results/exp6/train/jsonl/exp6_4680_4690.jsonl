Answer: \\boxed{20}.\n\n\nQuestion: Keegan is in school for 7.5 hours each day and he is taking 7 classes. He has history and chemistry classes for a combined total of 1.5 hours. How many minutes does Keegan spend in one of his other classes on average?\n\nKeegan has 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 other classes.\nHe has 7.5 - 1.5 = <<7.5-1.5=6>>6 total hours in his other classes.\nKeegan spends 6 x 60 = <<6*60=360>>360 minutes in his other classes.\nThus, Keegan spends 360/5 = <<360/5=72>>72 minutes in one of his other classes on average. Answer: \\boxed{72}.\n\n\nQuestion: Keegan is in school for 7.5 hours each day and he is taking 7 classes. He has history and chemistry classes for a combined total of 1.5 hours. How many minutes does Keegan spend in one of his other classes on average?\n\nKeegan is in school for a total of 7.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = <<7.5*60=450>>450 minutes.\nThe history and chemistry classes take up 1.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = <<1.5*60=90>>90 minutes.\nKeegan spends 450 minutes - 90 minutes = <<450-90=360>>360 minutes in his other classes.\nTherefore, Keegan spends an average of 360 minutes / 5 classes = <<360/5=72>>72 minutes in one of his other classes.

How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\n\nEmily spent $50 in total and $20 on art supplies, so she spent $50 - $20 = $<<50-20=30>>30 on skirts.\nSince she bought two skirts, each skirt cost $30 / 2 = $<<30/2=15>>15. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Emily spent X dollars on Friday, twice that amount on Saturday, and then three times X on Sunday. Over the three days, she spent $120. What is the value of X, in dollars?\n\nEmily spent 2X dollars on Saturday and 3X on Sunday for a total of 1X+2X+3X = <<1*1+2*1+3*1=6>>6X dollars\nWe know she spent 6X dollars over the 3 days to get 6X=120 dollars\nDividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get X=<<20=20>>20 dollars.
