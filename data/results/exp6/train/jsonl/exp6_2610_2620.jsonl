If he sells a dozen eggs for $3, how much money would he make in 8 weeks?\n\nThe farmer has a total of 46*6 = <<46*6=276>>276 eggs every week.\nHe has 276/12 = <<276/12=23>>23 dozens of eggs every week.\nThe farmer makes 23*3 = $<<23*3=69>>69 per week.\nIn 8 week, he would make 69*8 = $<<69*8=552>>552. Answer: \\boxed{552}.\n\n\nQuestion: A farmer has 46 chickens. Each chicken gives him 6 eggs a week. If he sells a dozen eggs for $3, how much money would he make in 8 weeks?\n\nIn one week, each chicken gives 6 eggs, so in 8 weeks, each chicken would give 6 x 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 eggs.\nThe farmer has 46 chickens, so in 8 weeks they would give 46 x 48 = <<46*48=2208>>2208 eggs.\nIn one dozen, there are 12 eggs, so in 8 weeks the farmer would have 2208/12 = <<2208/12=184>>184 dozen eggs.\nAt $3 per dozen, the farmer would make 184 x 3 = $<<184*3=552>>552. Answer: \\boxed{552}.\n\n\nQuestion: A farmer has 46 chickens. Each chicken gives him 6 eggs a week. If he sells a dozen eggs for $3, how much money would he make in 8 weeks?\n\nFirst find the total number of eggs one chicken gives per week: 6 eggs/chicken/week\nThen multiply that number by the number of chickens to find the total number of eggs per week: 6 eggs/chicken/week * 46 chickens = <<6*46=276>>276 eggs/week\nThen multiply that number by the number of weeks to find the total number of eggs: 276 eggs/week * 8 weeks = <<276*8=2208>>2208 eggs\nThen divide that number by the number of eggs per dozen to find the number of dozen eggs: 2208 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = <<2208/12=184>>184 dozen\nThen multiply the number of dozen eggs by the price per dozen to find the total price: 184 dozen * $3/dizen = $<<184*3=552>>552.

How much did he pay?\n\nThe deck was 30*40=<<30*40=1200>>1200 square feet\nHe paid $3+$1=$<<3+1=4>>4 per square foot\nThat means he paid 1200*4=$<<1200*4=4800>>4800. Answer: \\boxed{4800}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark is a lawyer who works at the county courthouse every day. It takes him 5 minutes to find parking and 3 minutes to walk into the courthouse. 2 days of the week it takes him 30 minutes to get through the metal detector and the other 3 days are less crowded so he gets through in 10 minutes. How long does he spend on all these activities in a week with 5 work days?\n\nMark spends 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 minutes on parking and walking into the courthouse every day.\nHe spends 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes going through the metal detector on the crowded days.\nHe spends 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 minutes going through the metal detector on the less crowded days.\nSo, Mark spends a total of 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes going through the metal detector in a week.\nTherefore, Mark spends a total of 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 minutes on parking and walking into the courthouse in a week.\nTherefore, the total time he spends on all these activities in a week is 40 + 90 = <<40+90=130>>130 minutes. Answer: \\boxed{130}.\n\n\nQuestion: Mark builds an apartment that is 16 by 10 feet.  There are 6 rooms in total.  All the rooms are the same size except the living room which is as big as 3 other rooms.  How big is the living room?\n", "text": "The total area of the apartment is 16 * 10 = 160 square feet. \nLet x be the size of the rooms.\nThe living room is 3x.\nThere are 6 rooms - 1 living room = 5 other rooms.\nThe total area of the other rooms is 5x.\nSo there is 3x + 5x = 8x.\n8x = 160 square feet.\nThus, the size of x is 160 / 8 = 20 square feet.\nTherefore, the living room is 20 * 3 = 60 square feet. Answer: \\boxed{60}."}

On a particular week, the number of students in the class on the second day was 40 more than the first day. The number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day was twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day. On the third day, 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick. If the total number of students in the class is 280, calculate the number of absent students in the three days.\n\nLet's assume the number of students present in the class on the first day was x.\nThe number of students present in the class on the second day was x+40.\n\nThe number of students who didn't turn up for the class on the second day is twice the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day.\nIf 1/7 of the total number of students of the class called in sick on the third day, then the number of students who didn't attend the class on the third day is 1/7*280 = <<1/7*280=40>>40\n\nIf the number of students who didn't turn up on the third day is 40, then the number of students who didn't turn up on the second day is twice that number, or 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80.\n\nIn both of the two days, the total number of absentees is 40+80 = <<40+80=120>>120\nThe total number of students present on the first and second days is x+(x+40) = 2x+40\nSince the total number of students in the class is 280, the number of students present on the first and second days is 2x+40 = 280\n\nFrom the equation, 2x+40 = 280, the value of x is 280-40/2 = 240/2 = <<240/2=120>>120\nThe number of students absent on the first day is x, which is 120.\n\nThe total number of absentees in the three days is 120+120 = <<120+120=240>>240.

On Wednesday, Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday. How much time in total did Adam spend at school during these 3 days, in hours?\n\nOn Monday Adam spent 6 * 30 = <<6*30=180>>180 minutes at school, which is 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours.\nOn Tuesday he had 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 minutes classes.\nSo on Tuesday he spent 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours at school.\nOn Wednesday he spent twice as much time as on Tuesday, so 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours.\nSo during these 3 days Adam spent in total 3 + 3 + 6 = <<3+3+6=12>>12 hours at school.
