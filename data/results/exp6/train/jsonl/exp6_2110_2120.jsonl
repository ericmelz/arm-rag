How long does it take before he can play the main game?\n\nFirst, we need to determine how long James spends installing the game. We know that he spends half as long installing it as he did downloading it, so that means he spends 10 minutes / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes installing the game.\nNext, we need to determine how long James spends going through the tutorial. We know that he spends triple the combined amount of time downloading and installing the game, so that means he spends 3 * (10 minutes + 5 minutes) = <<3*(10+5)=45>>45 minutes going through the tutorial.\nFinally, to determine how long James has to wait before he can play the main game, we add up the time spent downloading, installing, and going through the tutorial: 10 minutes + 5 minutes + 45 minutes = <<10+5+45=60>>60 minutes.

How long does it take before he can play the main game?\n\nJames spends 10 minutes downloading the game.\nThe installation takes half as long, which is 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes.\nGoing through the tutorial takes triple the combined amount of time, which is 3 * (10 + 5) = <<3*(10+5)=45>>45 minutes.\nTherefore, it takes a total of 10 + 5 + 45 = <<10+5+45=60>>60 minutes before James can play the main game.

How long does it take before he can play the main game?\n\nFirst, we need to find the total time James spends in the tutorial.\nThe time spent downloading the game is 10 minutes.\nThe time spent installing the game is half that, so it's 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes.\nThe combined time spent downloading and installing is 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 minutes.\nTriple that amount of time is 15 * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 minutes.\nTherefore, James must spend 45 minutes going through the tutorial.\nThus, it takes James 10 + 5 + 45 = <<10+5+45=60>>60 minutes before he can play the main game.

However, the expansion does add another 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay.  How much enjoyable gameplay does James get?\n\nThe base game promises 100 hours of gameplay, but 80% of that is boring grinding, which means only 100 - (100 * 80%) = 100 - 80 = <<100-(100*80*.01)=20>>20 hours are enjoyable.\nThe expansion adds another 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay.\nTherefore, James gets a total of 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 hours of enjoyable gameplay.

How much can Rodney lift?\n\nLet x represent how much Ron can lift.\nRoger:4x-7\nRodney:2(4x-7)=8x-14\nTotal:x+4x-7+8x-14=239\n13x-21=239\n13x=260\nx=<<20=20>>20\nRodney=8(20)-14=146 pounds. Answer: \\boxed{146}.\n\n\nQuestion: Rodney is a door-to-door salesman trying to sell home security systems. He gets a commission of $25 for each system he sells. He is canvassing a neighborhood of four streets with eight houses each. The first street gave him half the sales that the second street did, while every house on the third street turned him away and the fourth street resulted in only one sale. His total commission was $175. How many security systems did he sell on the second street?\n", "text": "Let S represent the number of security systems Rodney sold on the second street.\n\nFirst street sales: S/2\nSecond street sales: S\nThird street sales: 0\nFourth street sales: 1\n\nTotal sales: (S/2) + S + 0 + 1 = S + (S/2) + 1\n\nTotal commission: 25(S + (S/2) + 1)\n\nGiven that the total commission is $175, we can set up the equation:\n\n25(S + (S/2) + 1) = 175\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n25(3S/2 + 1) = 175\n75S/2 + 25 = 175\n75S/2 = 150\n75S = 300\nS = 4\n\nTherefore, Rodney sold 4 security systems on the second street.

If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?\n\nFirst find the difference in speed between the two runners: 9 miles/hour - 6 miles/hour = <<9-6=3>>3 miles/hour\nThen divide the distance of the head-start by the speed difference: 1 mile / 3 miles/hour = 1/3 hour\nThen convert that time to minutes: 1/3 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 20 minutes.
