Finally, the judge makes Mark pay $300 in court costs and he also has to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work.

Answer: \\boxed{210}.\n\n\nQuestion: Harry is joining a marathon that's why he practices and varies his workouts from day to day. He ran 10 meters per hour on Monday. From Tuesday to Thursday he ran 50% faster than on Monday. Then on Friday, he ran 60% faster than he ran on Thursday. How fast did Harry run on Friday?\n\nOn Tuesday to Thursday, Harry ran 10 x 50/100 = <<10*50/100=5>>5 meters faster.\nSo his speed on Tuesday to Thursday was 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 meters per hour.\nThen on Friday, he ran 15 x 60/100 = <<15*60/100=9>>9 meters faster than on Thursday.\nSo his speed on Friday was 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 meters per hour.
