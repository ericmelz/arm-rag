It costs 90 cents to make each pop, and the money from the pops will be used to buy pencils, which cost $1.80 each. How many pops must be sold to buy 100 pencils?\n\nTo buy 100 pencils, the school needs 100 * $1.80 = $<<100*1.80=180>>180.\nEach pop generates $1.50 - $0.90 = $<<1.50-0.90=0.60>>0.60.\nThus, $180 / $0.60 per pop = <<180/0.60=300>>300 pops must be sold.
