She packs a piece of cake on one randomly chosen day and cookies the other four days. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day?\n\nThere are 5 school days in a week, and Karen packs a ham sandwich on 3 of those days. The probability that Karen packs a ham sandwich on any given day is therefore $\\frac{3}{5}$. There is a 1 in 5 chance that Karen packs a cake on any given day. Therefore, the probability that Karen packs a ham sandwich and a cake on the same day is $\\frac{3}{5}\\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3}{25}$.\n\nExpressed as a percentage, this probability is $100\\left(\\frac{3}{25}\\right) = \\boxed{12}$ percent.\n\n\nQuestion: Karen packs peanut butter sandwiches in her daughter's lunch 2 randomly chosen days of the week. The other 3 school days, she packs a ham sandwich. She packs a piece of cake on one randomly chosen day and cookies the other four days. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day?\n\nThere are 2 days out of the 5 school days that Karen packs a peanut butter sandwich, so there are 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 days that she packs a ham sandwich.\nThere is a 1/5 = 0.20 = 20% chance that Karen packs a piece of cake on any given day.\nThus, there is a 3/5 * 1/5 = 3/25 = 0.12 = <<3/25=0.12>>12% chance that she packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day.

She knows each short-answer question takes 3 minutes to answer, each paragraph takes 15 minutes to write, and each essay takes an hour to write. If Karen assigns 2 essays and 5 paragraphs, how many short-answer questions should she assign if she wants to assign 4 hours of homework total?\n\nKaren assigns 2 essays * 1 hour per essay = <<2*1=2>>2 hours to essays.\nKaren assigns 5 paragraphs * 15 minutes per paragraph = <<5*15=75>>75 minutes to paragraphs.\nKaren needs to assign 4 hours * 60 minutes = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes of work.\nKaren has already assigned 2 hours * 60 minutes = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes of work.\nKaren has also assigned 75 + 120 = <<75+120=195>>195 minutes of work.\nKaren needs to assign 240 - 195 = <<240-195=45>>45 minutes of work.\nKaren has 45 minutes / 3 minutes = <<45/3=15>>15 short-answer questions. Answer: \\boxed{15}.\n\n\nQuestion: Karen is constantly trying to stop the raccoons from getting in her trash. The first lock she tries stalls them for 5 minutes. The next lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalled the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. How long is that?\n\nFirst find how long the second lock stalls the raccoons alone: 5 minutes * 3 - 3 minutes = <<5*3-3=12>>12 minutes\nThen multiply that number by 5 to find how long the raccoons are stalled by both locks: 12 minutes * 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 minutes.

If an elevator sign reads \u201cMaximum weight 600 pounds.\", what is the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator so that it will not be overloaded?\n\nThe combined weight of the three adults is 140 pounds x 3 = <<140*3=420>>420 pounds.\nAnd the combined weight of the two children is 64 pounds x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128 pounds.\nThe total weight of everyone inside the elevator is 420 + 128 = <<420+128=548>>548 pounds.\nSo, the maximum weight for the next person to get in the elevator without overloading is 600 - 548 = <<600-548=52>>52 pounds.
