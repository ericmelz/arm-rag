Since there were equal groups, the total number of balloons for each color is 672 / 4 = <<672/4=168>>168 balloons.\nSo Anya took half of the yellow balloons, which is 168 / 2 = <<168/2=84>>84 balloons. Answer: \\boxed{84}.\n\n\nQuestion: There were 672 balloons that were either green, blue, yellow, or red. They were divided into equal groups and then Anya took half of the yellow ones home. How many balloons did Anya take home?\n\nIf there were 672 balloons and they were divided into equal groups, there will be 672/4 = <<672/4=168>>168 balloons in each group\nAnya thus took home 168/2 = <<168/2=84>>84 yellow balloons. Answer: \\boxed{84}.\n\n\nQuestion: There were 672 balloons that were either green, blue, yellow, or red. They were divided into equal groups and then Anya took half of the yellow ones home. How many balloons did Anya take home?\n\nFirst find how many balloons are in each group by dividing the total number of balloons by the number of groups: 672 balloons / 4 groups = <<672/4=168>>168 balloons/group\nThen divide that number by the fraction of balloons Anya took home to find how many yellow balloons she took: 168 balloons/group / 2 = <<168/2=84>>84 balloons/group. Answer: \\boxed{84}.\n\n\nQuestion: Anya has 4 times as many erasers as Andrea. If Andrea has 4 erasers, how many more erasers does Anya have than Andrea?\n\nAnya has 4 times the number of erasers as Andrea, so Anya has 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 erasers.\nAnya has 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 more erasers than Andrea. Answer: \\boxed{12}.\n\n\nQuestion: Tom and his friends were filling up water balloons. Tom filled up 3 times as many water balloons as Luke. Luke filled up one fourth as many balloons as Anthony. If Anthony filled up 44 water balloons, how many did Tom fill up?\n\nLuke filled up 44/4 = <<44/4=11>>11 water balloons.\nTom filled up 11 * 3 = <<11*3=33>>33 water balloons. Answer: \\boxed{33}.\n\n\nQuestion: There were 672 balloons that were either green, blue, yellow, or red. They were divided into equal groups and then Anya took half of the yellow ones home. How many balloons did Anya take home?\n", "text": "Anya took home half of the yellow balloons. To find the total number of yellow balloons, we divide the total number of balloons by 4 (the number of colors). Therefore, there are 672 / 4 = 168 yellow balloons. Anya took home half of the yellow balloons, which is 168 / 2 = 84 balloons. Answer: \\boxed{84}."}

How many shoes does Bobby have?\n\nLet x be the number of pairs of shoes Becky owns\nTwice as many pairs of shoes as Becky owns is 2*x = <<2*x=2*x>>2x\n5 less than twice as many pairs of shoes as Becky owns is 2x-5\nBobby = 3 * Becky = 3 *x\nBonny bought her 13th pair of shoes so 2x-5 = 13\nAdd 5 to each side of the equation: 2x-5+5 = 13+5\nCombine like terms: 2x = 18\nDivide each side by 2: 2x/2 = 18/2\nSimplify both sides: x = <<9=9>>9.\nBobby = 3 * Becky = 3 * 9 = <<3*9=27>>27 pairs of shoes.
