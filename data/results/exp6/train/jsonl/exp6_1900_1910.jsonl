If Nancy\u2019s daily water intake is 54 pounds, how much, in pounds, does she weigh?\n\nLet W be Nancy\u2019s weight in pounds.\nNancy drinks 0.6 * W pounds of water a day.\nSince her daily water intake is 54 pounds W = 54 / 0.6 = <<54/0.6=90>>90 pounds.

If Nancy\u2019s daily water intake is 54 pounds, how much, in pounds, does she weigh?\n\nLet Nancy\u2019s body weight be x pounds.\nSince she drinks the equivalent of 60% of her body weight in water, her daily water intake is 60/100*x = 60/100*x pounds = 0.6*x pounds.\nIf Nancy\u2019s daily water intake is 54 pounds, then 0.6*x = 54.\nTherefore, the weight of Nancy, x = 54/0.6 = <<54/0.6=90>>90 pounds.

If Nancy\u2019s daily water intake is 54 pounds, how much, in pounds, does she weigh?\n\nLet \"x\" be the weight of Nancy in pounds.\nIf the daily water intake is 54 pounds, then 60/100*x=54 pounds\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 100/60 gives x=54*100/60\nSo Nancy weighs x=<<90=90>>90 pounds.

If Nancy\u2019s daily water intake is 54 pounds, how much, in pounds, does she weigh?\n\nLet Nancy's weight be \"w\" pounds.\nSince she drinks the equivalent of 60% of her body weight in water, she drinks 0.60*w = 54 pounds of water daily.\nThe value of w that satisfies this condition is w = 54 / 0.60 = <<54/0.60=90>>90 pounds.
